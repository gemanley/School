<p><i><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ on FAQ </font></i></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q1: Where are FAQ posted? </font></p>

<p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Most FAQ are posted on this page. Some last minute additions to FAQs 
are posted by TAs at
  <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~sma/cs363">
  http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~sma/cs363</a>. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q2: How do I know if FAQ have 
changed from last time I visited this page? </font></p>

<p>

<font face="Times New Roman">For your ease 
  of reference, we will highlight recent changes and additions on this page in 
  <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q3: 
Are all clarifications to projects and homeworks posted on FAQ? </font></p>

<p>

<font face="Times New Roman">No, all clarifications of projects and homeworks 
are NOT posted here. Sometimes we will revise a project and homework statement 
itself, highlighting such changes in blue. This has the advantage that you see 
the changes in a greater and exact context that you are already familiar with. To 
keep you informed to such changes, we usually 
  post news. </font>

</p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ on all projects (specially Project 0) </font></i></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q1: Why do I need English 
version of Windows XP? What if I have some other Windows platform? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The English language version Windows XP (Home or 
Professional) is our official platform for Com S 363. We have developed the 
course in a way that you can use any Windows XP computer available to you to 
complete your projects. Please note that all PCs in our labs have Windows XP.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">We have some courseware that we only test on 
Windows XP. If you are using your own computer, please upgrade to Windows XP if 
you do not already have it on your PC. In past a small number of students have 
experienced problems on Windows 2000 or even on non-English version of XP! 
Please note that we will not be able to help you on any platform other than 
English version of Windows XP. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q2: Where can I get Windows XP 
from? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">While you are registered in a computer science 
(Com S) course, you can obtain a copy of Windows XP from a PC in our lab by 
burning it on a CD. Then obtain a key for your copy from Jim Schlosser, the head 
of our System Support Group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Gadia can usually provide you with a blank CD as 
a courtesy. To obtain one, just go to his office. For this purpose, you can 
interrupt him if you see him in his office. Please do not make any phone calls 
or send email about it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q3: Why do I need a unix 
account?&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You will need a unix account for electronic 
submission of your project. Details for submission are provided with every 
project.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q4: Do I have to use unix 
account for submitting my projects?&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Yes. In rare cases of hardship, we allow 
submission as attachments to email to one of the TAs. This is ordinarily done by 
a prior arrangement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q5: How to get a CS UNIX and 
Windows account?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to complete the projects in CS363, you 
need to register for UNIX and Windows CS account. If you face difficulties, 
please see System Support Group in our department. Thee are located on the 
north-east corner on the first floor of Atanasoff Hall. </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Case 1. You have neither Unix nor Windows account.</i>
  <font face="Times New Roman">There is a terminal in Computer Science Lab in 
  116 Atanasoff Hall that can be used to create accounts for you. The system 
  checks to make sure that you are registered in a computer science course and 
  creates both Unix and Windows accounts for you. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Case 2. You have a Windows account but not Unix 
  account.</i> To register for Windows account, go to the following link:
  <a href="http://support.cs.iastate.edu/accounts.php3">
  http://support.cs.iastate.edu/accounts.php3</a>. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Case 3: You already have Windows account.</i> 
  In this case you already have Unix account as well in our department. 
  Therefore, you have both the accounts and you can proceed with your projects.
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q6: What is batch file in 
Windows? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A batch file contains a batch of commands that 
eare to be executed sequentially. A batch file with extension .bat can be 
executed by double clicking on it eliminating the need to entering cryptic 
commands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q7: How to set up the path and 
classpath for running java program? How to compile and run a java program?
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Com S 363, we highly recommend that you 
streamline all these through the use of a Windows batch file. Sample command 
files are provided with each project. Here are some tips: </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A.</b> The <font color="#800000">following 
command sets path variable</font>. It tells Windows where to find java 
executables. Note the underscore character carefully. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">set PATH=c:\j2sdk1.4.0_01\bin\ </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>B.</b> The <font color="#800000">following 
command sets CLASSPATH variable</font>.&nbsp; It tells java where to find the 
class files and the libraries in order to execute java programs. Make sure the 
underline part is the directory in which your java lib is located. Also note 
that &quot;.&quot; tells java to look for a class in the current directory (where the 
batch file is being executed from). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">set CLASSPATH=.; c:\J2SDK1.4.0_01\lib</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>C.</b> To <font color="#800000">compile a 
java program</font> that is in MyProg.java the following command is needed.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">javac MyProg.java</font></p>

<p>When the above command is executes, java will create MyProg.class. Java has 
its own way of executing a class file. Java considers a class file as an 
executable program. </p>

<p>FYI: The code contained in a java program is called java byte-code. The 
byte-code is meant to be machine independent and can be executed on java virtual 
machine (JVM). JVM is an executable, included with java for every platform. </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>D.</b> The following will
<font color="#800000">compile all java programs in the current directory</font> 
(where the batch file is being executed from). </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">javac *.java </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>E.</b> The following will run MyProg.class
</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">java MyProg&nbsp; </font></p>

<p>If MyProg outputs something to the screen, the <font color="#800000">output 
can be redirected to a file</font>, say MyFile.txt by the following command. </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">java MyProg &gt; MyFile.txt </font></p>

<p>Then MyProg is executed, the file MyFile.txt will be created in the current 
directory <font face="Times New Roman">(where the batch file is being executed 
from). </font>If the file has to be stored elsewhere, full path name should be 
provided (e.g. <font size="2" face="Courier New">java MyProg &gt; D:\MyFavoriteFiles\PyFile.txt</font>). </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q8: What is wrong if I get the 
error message saying “'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external 
command, operable program or batch file.”? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you get such an error, that means your java 
path is not set up correctly. The system couldn’t find java.exe. So please set 
up the path for java. If you already have a path command in your batch file, 
make sure that it is correct. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q9: How to check the PATH and 
CLASSPATH system variables are already set up? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In your project directory, create a text file 
called Check.bat with the following command in it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">set</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, double click on Check.bat. This will list 
all the system variables including path and classpath. You can check if your 
path and classpath are on the list. If they are, you set up them correctly. 
Otherwise, you have to set up again. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ on Project 1 </font></i></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q1: What is wrong when I get an 
error stating that the application failed to initialize properly when it tried 
to run SQLRunner.exe? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is because that you haven’t installed .Net 
framework. Instructions for installing it are included in Project 0. It is about 
20MB size. Please note that .NET Framework is installed on all CS machines and 
your should not encounter this problem there. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q2: SQL Why SQL Runner does not 
display properly on Windows desktop? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">SQL Runner seems to function perfectly on the
<font color="#FF0000">English version of Windows XP</font>, Home as well as 
Professional. We cannot troubleshoot non-English, platforms other than XP. If 
you experience problems on English version of XP, please bring your problems to 
our attention and we will try to help you. </font></p>

<P><font color="#FF0000">Q3: Why can't I get EXCEPT, NJOIN, INTERSECT to work in 
SQL Runner. What operators are not supported or only partially suported.&nbsp; </font> 
</P>
<P>If some operators are not working in SQL Runner, most likely the problem is 
not with the Runner. The Runner does not really execute any commands, it just 
sends them for execution to the database system being connected to. In our 
course we use the built-in database capabilities of the XP + .NET Framework that 
are at par with Microsoft Access. Although SQL is supposed to be an industry 
standard, in reality there are differences across database platforms. If you 
connected to a different database system some commands that do not work may work 
there and vice versa.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Here is a list of commands that you may experience some problems with. 
</P>
<ul>
  <li>EXCEPT is not supported </li>
  <li>INTERSECTION is not supported </li>
  <li>NATURAL JOIN (or NJOIN) is not supported.
  </li>
  <li>Union is supported in the form &quot;(select ... ) union (select ...)&quot; but not <FONT face="Courier New" size=2>
  in a nested form such as "select * from (... 
UNION ...)".</FONT></li>
  <li>IN and NOT IN are supported, but they can be used only for one 
attribute. For example, the following usage is supported: ... x.A in (select y.B 
  from ...), but the following is not supported: <FONT face="Courier New" 
size=2>"... (x.A, x.B) IN (select y.C, y.D from ....)". </FONT></li>
</ul>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q4: Should my result set be "reasonable"? For 
example, the item 14 of&nbsp; project 1,&nbsp; its result set contains 500 level 
CS courses which are taken by freshman students.</FONT></P>
<P>We try  to make our database reasonable. If you get some unreasonable 
result, please check the original database for correctness. Your results should 
be correct only relative to the state of the database. </P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q5: For the Item 30, what is meant 
by "if they have more than 5 students whose GPA &gt; 3.0, then raise their 
Salary by 10%." ?</FONT></P>
<P>For each of those two instructors, if the instructor is the mentor of&nbsp; 
more than 5 students whose GPA &gt; 3.0, then raise their Salary by 10%.</P>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">set PATH=c:\j2sdk1.4.0_01\bin\ </font></p>

all the system variables including path and classpath. You can check if your 
path and classpath are on the list. If they are, you set up them correctly. 
Otherwise, you have to set up again. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Q 10: The use of quotation marks around values is 
giving problems or exhibits inconsistent behavior in that in some queries they 
work and in others they do not. How can this be fixed? </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">When SQL queries are downloaded or transferred by 
cut-and-paste from the web, sometimes the quotation marks seem to get corrupt. 
In such cases simply retyping the quotation marks seems to help. </font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ on Project 2 </font></i></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Q1: What is wrong if I get an 
error message saying “SQLException: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source 
name not found “? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That means you either you haven’t set up your 
data source name correctly, or, you are using a different source name in your 
program. The procedure for setting up the data source is explained in detail on 
a web page: [Software_Systems] &gt; [JDBC] &gt; See section on data source. </font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ on Project 3 </font></i></p>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q1: I get an error when I execute 
an XQuery with the return clause containing 
two or more elements.</FONT></P>
<P>You cannot return multiple elements. Examples of incorrect and correct 
versions are shown below: </P>
<P>The following is not correct: </P>
<P><font face="Courier New">... return $i/Rank, $i/Salary</font> </P>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q3: For Item 04, what do you mean by "make sure 
that there is one element per student"?</FONT></P>
<P>"One element per student" means that all information to be reported for a 
given student should be put inside a single element. For example, suppose a 
student with id s55 is enrolled in CS301, CS 320, and CS 415 can be reported as 
follows. Here an &quot;Entry&quot; tag is used to build a single element for all the 
information to be recorded. </P>
<P>&lt;Entry&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;StudentID&gt;s55&lt;/StudentID&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;CourseCode&gt;CS301&lt;/CourseCode&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;CourseCode&gt;CS320&lt;/CourseCode&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;CourseCode&gt;CS415&lt;/CourseCode&gt;<BR>&lt;/Entry&gt;</P>
<P>Note that all students will not be taking the same number of courses. Those 
students who are not enrolled in any course should not be reported. </P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q4: Item 5 states that the query 
should not use any constants such as "Freshman". What does this mean 
exactly?</FONT></P>
<P>This means the query can not contain literals: "Freshman", "Junior", etc. 
Hint: use a variable to get the classification from the xml document. Also you 
cannot use credit hours to identify the classification of a student. </P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q5: Hint for Item 2:</FONT></P>
<P>You could use concat() function to concatenate the strings in your return 
clause.</P>

<P><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>FAQ on Project 
4:</FONT></I></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000>Q1: 
Why do we need to use the iterator? I can write the program without using an 
iterator. </FONT></P>
<P>You MUST try to understand that a profoundly important point is being made 
here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Iterators are important for container classes. Collections are important 
container classes and they arise naturally in databases. For example, a relation 
is a set of tuples, an xml document is a sequence of elements. Iterators are 
designed to supply one item (tuple, element, etc.) at a time as needed by a 
client hiding the drudgery of low-level navigation within a collection. </P>
<P>In this project you are wearing two hats. The application for xml document 
that you are writing is client of the iterator, The application has its own 
logic. You are also implementing the iterator, that has its own logic requiring 
you to get into cumbersome internal navigation of the xml document. The two 
logics are indeed independent of each other. Writing a program means without the 
iterator will absolutely lead to spaghetti-code. Once you have implemented an 
iterator, you can use it to solve a variety of applications requiring you to 
concentrate only upon the logic of the application. </P>
<P>The concept of JDBC-like programming paradigm is based upon the concept of an 
iterator. At the heart of JDBC is the result-set iterator. For relational 
databases iterators are simple, because all objects (tuples) are uniformly 
structured. For xml, iterators can be significantly complex and a framework such 
as JDBC is not yet available. </P>
<P>Iterators are also very important in database implementation. Without 
iterators, automatic generation of object-code would be very difficult, prone to 
bugs, and very difficult to maintain. This because the clients view of a 
relation as a set of tuples is very distant from system's block oriented view of 
tuples. </P>
<P>If you are still having difficulty understanding this point or are more 
curious, you are encouraged to see the instructor. He will show you how 
iterators are composed to automate code generation for database queries that is 
composed of subqueries. </P>
<P>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000">Q2: I got an error about the type 
&quot;double&quot; when doing xtp.getElement().</font></P>
<P>xtp.getElement() will return a String. You have to first convert the String 
to a double, then assign the double value to the GPA variable. The function of 
converting String to double is: Double.parseDouble() which takes a String 
argument and returns a double data type.</P>
