<p><i><font face="Arial">Exercises in information integration&nbsp; </font></i></font><i><font SIZE="5" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></i></p>
<p><b>Acknowledgement. </b>Several exercises below have been taken from Garcia-Monila, 
Ullman, Widom book. This is based upon the permission from the Prentice Hall, 
the publisher of the book. The Authors / Publisher hold the copyright in such 
cases. </p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.</b> Computer company A keeps data about the PC mode1s it sells 
in the schema: <br>
<br>
Computers(number, proc, speed, memory, hd) <br>
Monitors (number, screen, maxResX, maxResY) <br>
<br>
For instance the tuple (123, PIII, 1000, 128, 40) in Computers means that model 123 has a Pentium-III processor running at 1000 megahertz, with 128M of memory 
and a 40G hard disk. The tuple (456, 19, 1600, 1200) in Monitors means that 
model 456 has a 19-inch screen with a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. <br>
<br>
Computer company B only sells complete systems, consisting of a computer and 
monitor. Its schema is <br>
<br>
Systems (id, processor, mem, disk, screenSize) <br>
<br>
The attribute processor is an integer speed; the type of processor (e.g., 
Pentium-III) is not recorded. Neither is the maximum resolution of the monitor 
recorded. Attributes id, mem, and disk are analogous to number, memory, and hd 
from company A, but the disk size is measured in megabytes instead of gigabytes.
<br>
<br>
a) If company A wants to insert into its relations information about the 
corresponding items from B, what SQL insert statements should it use? <br>
<br>
b) If Company B wants to insert into Systems as much information about the 
systems that can he built, from computers and monitors made by A, what SQL 
statements best allow this information to be obtained? <br>
<br>
<b>Exercise 2.</b> In Exercise 1 we spoke of two computer companies, A and B, 
that used different schemas for information about their products. Suppose we 
have a mediator with schema <br>
<br>
PCMed (manf, speed, mem, disk, screen) <br>
<br>
with the intuitive meaning that a tuple gives the manufacturer (A or B), 
processor speed, main-memory size, hard-disk size, and screen size for one of 
the systems you could buy from that company. Write wrapper templates for the 
following types of queries. Note that you need to write two templates for each 
query, one for each of the manufacturers. <br>
<br>
Question: Given memory and disk sizes, find the matching tuples. <br>
<br>
<b>Exercise 3.</b> An on-line seller of computers wishes to maintain data about 
orders. Customers can order their PC with any of several processors, a selected 
amount of main memory, any of several disk units, and any of several CD or DVD 
readers. The fact tablee for such a database might be: <br>
<br>
Orders(cust, date, proc, memory, hd, rd, quant, price) <br>
<br>
We should understand attribute cust to be an ID that is the foreign key for a 
dimension table about customers, and understand attributes proc, hd (hard disk), 
and rd (removable disk: CD or DVD, typically) similarly. For example, an hd ID 
might be elaborated in a dimension table giving the manufacturer of the disk and 
several disk characteristics. The memory attribute is simply an integer: the 
number of megabytes of memory ordered. The quant attribute is the number of 
machines of this type ordered by this customer, and the price attribute is the 
total cost of each machine ordered. <br>
<br>
a) Which are dimension attributes, and which are dependent attributes? <br>
b) For some of the dimension attributes, a dimension table is likely to be 
needed. Suggest appropriate schemas for these dimension tables. <br>
<br>
<b>Exercise 4.</b> What is the ratio of the size of CUBE(F) to the size of F if 
fact table F has the following characteristics? <br>
<br>
a) F has ten dimension attributes, each with ten different values. <br>
b) F has ten dimension attributes, each with two different values. <br>
<br>
<b>Exercise 5.</b> Let us use the 4-dimensional cube CUBE(Sales) from your book 
which was built from the relation <br>
<br>
Sales(model, color, date, dealer, val, cnt) <br>
<br>
Tell what tuples of the cube we would use to answer the following queries: <br>
<br>
a) Find the total sales of blue cars for each dealer. <br>
b) Find the total number of green Gobis sold by dealer "Smilin Sally". <br>
c) Find the average number of Gobis sold on each day of March, 2002 by each 
dealer. </p><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
