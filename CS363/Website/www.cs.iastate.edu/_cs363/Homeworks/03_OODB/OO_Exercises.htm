<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Project 1 we considered a University application in the 
relational database setting. The following is a scheme for the same application 
in our own object-oriented setting. Luckily for us, every relation becomes a 
collection of objects. A Student is a person and a Faculty is also a person. 
These are shown as directed edges labeled &quot;isa&quot;. All other directed edges show 
reference attributes. Note that PreReq attribute in Course is a set of 
references. </p>

<p>In our own SQL-like language, express each of the following in terms of 
single select statement. Of course, a select statement may have other nested 
selects. Note that <font color="#FF0000">our problem numbers deliberately start at 07</font>. Problems 07-12 
will directly correspond to Items 07-12 on a future project where you will be 
asked to write object-oriented style XQuery queries instead of our SQL-style 
queries.&nbsp; FYI, Items 01 to 06 in that project will be about relational 
style XQuery queries. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Feel free to come-up with any constructs for your SQL 
queries so long as they make sense from a logical standpoint. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 07.</b> List the FacultyID, Rank and Salary of 
    the faculty who is a professor with a salary of 100K or higher.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 08.</b> List the StudentIDs of students and the 
    FacultyIDs of their Mentors for students who have got at least one A's in 
    their grades.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 09.</b> List the names of students and the 
    FacultyIDs of their Mentors for students who have got all A's in their 
    grades.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 10.</b> List the course codes of those courses 
    that are prerequisites of prerequisites for the course ‘CS511’. We only want 
    second level prerequisites. You should ignore immediate prerequisites.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 11. </b>For each classification, list the number 
    of students and average GPA. Your query should not use constants, such as 
    &quot;Freshman&quot;. In the output, each tuple should consist of 
    Classification, NumOfStudents, and AvgGPA. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem 12. </b>Reorganize Enrollment collection by StudentID. 
    For each student you should have retrieve the student's id and a Grade. The 
    Grade should be a relation consisting of CourseCode and LetterGrade 
    attributes. </p>
