<p>Problems are not necessarily in increasing order of difficulty. Although 
exact compliance with SQL, JDBC, Java, OQL, and XML standards is not required, 
your answers should be thoughtful. For example, to register a JDBC-driver, a 
statement such as “Register (MyDriver);” can be used. <br>
<br>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><b>1.</b> You are given the following 
ODMG-like database. In this particular example you see reference attributes and 
inheritance, but there are no relationships.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Person(Name, DOB) {extent is persons}<br>
Employee (Salary, WorksIn: Department) extends Person {extent is emps} <br>
Department (Dname, ManagedBy: Manager) {extent is depts} <br>
Manager (Budget()) extends Employee {extent is managers}; Assume that Budget( ) 
is a function that returns a numeric value.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Express &quot;List names of employees and names and date of birth of 
their managers who have a budget above 1 million dollars&quot; as an OQL-like query. </p>
</font>
<p><b>2.</b> Assume that a mediator database consisting of the following 
relations is given: </p>
<p>PCMed (Model, ProcessorSpeed, DiskSize, MemorySize, ScreenSize, Price, 
Dealer)<br>
pMed (ProcessorSpeed, Dealer)<br>
dMed (DiskSize, Dealer)<br>
mMed (MemorySize, Dealer) <br>
sMed (ScreenSize, Dealer)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Four templates are available to query PCMed by specific a value of 
  processor speed, or by a specific value of disk size, or by specific value of 
  memory size, or by specific value of screen size. </li>
  <li>Four templates are available for querying the pMed, dMed, mMed, and sMed, 
  relations by a specific Dealer-value. Assume that the number of choices of 
  processor speeds is approximately 10, but it changes from time to time. Same 
  remarks apply to memories, disks, and screens. </li>
</ul>
<p>With SQL and JDBC frameworks at your disposal, how would you retrieve 
inventory of Dealer = “MaxPC” for models priced below $1,000? No code is 
necessary, just describe your idea in plain English. Assume that the query is 
asked frequently. </p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Consider a summary relation Sales (Model, Color, Dealer, Value, 
TheCount) to which data cube operator is applied. Assume that Sales (?,?,?,?,?) 
can be used in the from clause of an SQL statement, where each “?” is a 
variable, a constant, or *. <i>Express for the  Turbo model, list the count and 
average value of all cars sold by each dealer for each color</i>. </p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Contents of an XML file Catalog.xml, for information about books, is shown below. Assume all 
books have one or more authors. Write a FLWR expression that would create a 
single ‘authors’ element for each book where all “author” elements for the book 
will be nested. <br>
&lt;bib&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;book year = &quot;2000&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;title&gt;Data on the Web&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;author&gt;&lt;last&gt;Abiteboul&lt;/last&gt;&lt;first&gt;Serge&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;author&gt;&lt;last&gt;Buneman&lt;/last&gt;&lt;first&gt;Peter&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;author&gt;&lt;last&gt;Suciu&lt;/last&gt;&lt;first&gt;Dan&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;publisher&gt;Morgan Kaufmann Publishers&lt;/publisher&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;price&gt; 39.95&lt;/price&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;/book&gt;<br>
...<br>
&lt;/bib&gt; </p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><b>5.</b> Give concrete example of a 
relation ABC such that its decomposition (AB, BC) is lossy. This happens when 
you join the two relations AB and BC by matching their B-values, what you get is 
not the same as the original relation ABC. </font>
