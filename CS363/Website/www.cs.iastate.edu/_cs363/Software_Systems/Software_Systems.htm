<hr>
<h3>Preliminary Steps&nbsp;</h3>
      <ul>
		<li><font face="Times New Roman">Windows users: We strongly recommend 
		that the file extensions be visible in the File Explorer in Windows. By 
		default the extensions are invisible when Windows is installed. After 
		Googling &quot;Show file extensions&quot; I found a link
		<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/865219">
		http://support.microsoft.com/kb/865219</a> that describes it for Windows 
		XP and Windows 7. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Times New Roman">Create a folder named
		<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">P0</span> anywhere on your 
		system. All files to be submitted for this project will be stored here. 
		For your convenience on this page we have
		<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">highlighted</span> names of all 
		files to be stored in P0. Be sure that you do not store any other files 
		in this folder. </font></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>A. CyDIW&nbsp;</h3>
      <hr>
      <p align="left">CyDIW is a seamless low profile GUI-based multi-purpose develop 
		environment for experimenting with multiple command-based systems. It 
		can be used to connect to multiple database servers and our own database 
		prototypes and use them simultaneously with 
		great ease. Batches of commands from multiple systems can be developed 
		and executed. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Install CyDIW.</b> Obtain CyDIW from
		<a href="../Resources/CyDIW_Root.zip">Resources/CyDIW_Root.zip</a> and unzip it in a folder of 
your choice. (On computers in Pearson store it in a folder on U: drive.) That 
is all what is needed to install it. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Run a demo in CyDIW (Windows users).</b> Double click on StartCyDIW.bat. 
A GUI window will open. As stated above, the GUI is provides an integrated 
development environment (IDE) for command-based systems. It has an editor - cum - launchpad&nbsp; for batches 
of commands that are stored as plain text files. Use the [Open] button to load 
ComS363_XQuery(Saxon)_Demo.txt file. (This file is in the ComS363 folder created 
earlier.) This is a demo for XQuery that uses the Saxon 
XQuery query engine pre-packaged and configured in CyDIW for immediate use. Click [Run 
All] button. You should see the output in the output pane. Save this output in 
the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ComS363_XQuery(Saxon)_Demo.htm</span> 
file in a folder P0. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Non-Windows users.</b> Instead of StartCyDIW.bat, execute 
startcydiw.sh instead in a Unix-based system. Caution: CyDIW is not stress 
tested for non-Windows platforms. If you have problems, we will work with you to 
some extent, but any feedback will especially be useful in future. If problems 
persist, you may consider switching to Windows. </p>
<p align="left"><b>FYI - What is CyDIW.</b> Any command-based system can be 
configured and used with CyDIW (Cyclone Database Implementation Workbench). More 
significantly, it also includes infrastructure for implementation of database 
internals. This infrastructure is used by several database prototype platforms 
that we are implementing. The platform offers a good paradigm for database 
implementation leading to very high level encapsulation in terms of batches of 
commands.&nbsp;CyDIW can be used by students, TAs, instructors, developers, and 
project directors. <a href="../Resources/TKDE-2010-07-0425.R1_Zhao.pdf">Get this</a> 
if you want to learn more; a knowledge of this is not required for the course.
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF"><b>Difficulties with 
CyDIW and suggestions.</b> </span>Please keep us posted and discuss them with 
us. CyDIW includes numerous suggestions made by students in past. We are very 
keen on making improvements. </p>
<hr>
<h3>B. Java &nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
<hr>
<p>You will use Java explicitly in Project 0, 2 and 4. In other 
projects it will be used implicitly by CyDIW.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Install Java.</b> You probably 
	already have Java installed on your computer. Our labs in Pearson already 
have Java installed on them. If you do not have java on your computer, <font size="3">
download and install the latest version of java JDK from&nbsp; <a href="http://java.com/">
http://java.com</a>. (Make sure that you get JDK.) </font> </p>
<p><b>Setup the demo for Java.</b> Create a working directory on your computer and store
<a href="Java/Java_Demo.java">Java_Demo.java</a> it it. (In Pearson create the 
working directory on U: drive.) </p>
<p><b>Expected output of the demo.</b> When demo is run you should see the output &quot;JAVA IS WORKING&quot;. 
Save the contents of the output in <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
Java_Demo_Output.txt</span> file in folder P0. 
</p>
<p> <font size="3">Below we have described three options on how to run Java. </font>
You should decide on a preferred manner in which you will use Java on your 
machine.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Option A. Running the demo for Eclipse users (Windows or non-Windows).</b> If you use an Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, we assume you know how to do it. </p>
<p><b>Option B. Running the demo from command line.</b> If you wish to use command line 
interface, we assume you know how to do it. </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Windows Users:</b> Available on Windows via [Start Button] &gt; 
	[Run], enter cmd &gt; [Enter key]. </li>
	<li><b>Non-Windows users:</b> If you tell us how you use it on your system, 
	we will publicize it for others. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Option C. Windows users: running the demo from a .bat file.</b> If you want to use Windows .bat file, here is some help. Fetch
	<a href="Java/Java_Demo.bat.txt">Java_Demo.bat.txt</a> and store it on the working 
	folder that you have created. Edit this file in a text editor such as WordPad. Modify the setting for path and classpath variable
<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">for the 
  computer that you are using</span>. Save the file
	<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">as a text file</span>. (Make sure 
that you have saved it as a plain text file.)&nbsp; Remove the &quot;.txt&quot; suffix 
from its name. This configures the .bat file for your machine. Now double click 
on the batch file to execute it. A file named Java_Demo_Output.txt will be created. In this file you should see 
the expected output. </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Non-Windows users:</b> If you tell us how you use it on your system, 
	we will publicize it for others. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 align="left"><b>C. Configuration of CyDIW for MySQL</b> </h3>
<hr>
<P>CyDIW is preconfigured for MySQL - a popular quasi Open Source SQL database engine. 
A<FONT size=3> database named <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">xyz</span>DB - where xyz is your ISU NetID - has 
been created for your individual use on our MySQL server in Pearson. CyDIW needs 
to be configured so that it can connect to your database. </FONT> 
</P>
<p align="left"><b>Configure CyDIW for your database.</b> First close CyDIW if 
it is running. Open SystemConfig.xml file for editing. Make sure to use a plain 
text or XML editor that will not leave any hidden characters in the file. The following shows 
the configuration setting for MySQL. <FONT size=3> Carefully replace
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">highlighted</span> portions with your 
information provided below. Be careful that the file is </FONT>saved 
as a plain text file<FONT size=3> </FONT> 
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;Client Name=&quot;MySQL&quot; Prefix=&quot;$MySQL&quot; Enabled=&quot;yes&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassPath=&quot;&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LibraryPath=&quot;sql\drivers&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClientAdapter=&quot;clientsmanager.clients.SQLClientAdapter&quot; 
DriverClass=&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConnectionString=&quot;jdbc:mysql://csdb.cs.iastate.ed<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">u:3306</span>/<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">NameOfYourDatabase</span>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Username=&quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">YourUserName</span>&quot; 
Password=&quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">YourPassword&quot;</span> /&gt; 
</P>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, if your ISU Net ID were “<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lexluthor</span>” 
and your Student ID number was “6016246<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">56</span>”, 
you would use:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal">YourUsername is your ISU Net ID (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lexluthor</span>)</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal">YourPassword is your ISU Net ID + &quot;-&quot; + Last 2 of 
	Student ID Number (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lexluthor-56</span>)</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoNormal">NameOfYourDatabase is your ISU Net ID + &quot;DB&quot; (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lexluthorDB</span>)</li>
</ul>
<P>Note that as a database lexluthorDB is empty. In this database you have the privilege to create tables, populate them, query and 
update them, and delete them. This is all what matters for the project. You 
cannot delete the database. The password we have provided is a low security 
issue. By using your username and password, others can perhaps look at your 
database but they cannot see your code (the batch of commands) that was used to 
arrive at the current state of your database. 
</P>
<P><b>Run a demo.</b> Double click on StartCyDIW.bat to 
start CyDIW. Using the [Open] button load the batch of commands in 
ComS363_MySQL_Demo.txt. (This file is in the ComS363 folder created earlier.) Then press [Run All] button. The demo should run. Save 
the contents of the Output Pane in <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
ComS363_MySQL_Demo_Output.htm</span> file in folder P0. Be sure to provide the 
.htm extension as a part of your file name. You will submit this file as a part 
of Project P0.&nbsp;  
</P>

<h3>D. Setup JDBC and run a demo&nbsp; </h3>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>Setup JDBC.</b> Download and store MySQL driver 
<a href="../Resources/mysql-connector-java-5.0.5.jar">mysql-connector-java-5.0.5.jar</a> 
and the demo program <a href="JDBC/JDBC_Demo.java">JDBC_Demo.java</a> in the 
same 
working directory. 
	Open the java file for editing and replace NameOfYourDatabase, YourUserName, 
and YourPassword&quot; with the same values as in Part C. above. 
	</p>
<p align="left"><b>Setup the database.</b> Run the MySQL demo, covered in 
Section C above, so that your database has two tables 
	with tuples in them. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Expected output of the demo.</b> To see the expected output 
of the demo please <a href="JDBC/JDBC_Demo_Output.txt">click here</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Option A. Setup and running the demo for Eclipse users.</b> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%">
Follow the steps below. (i) Create a project congaing JDBC_Demo.java. (ii) Add 
the MySQL driver to your build path. To see it in a picture,
<a href="JDBC/BuildPathInEclipse.JPG">click here</a>. (iii) Run the demo 
program.&nbsp; </span> </p>
<p><b>Option B. Running the demo for command line users.</b> The commands are as follows: </p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">javac 
JDBC_Demo.java <br>
java -cp &quot;.;mysql-connector-java-5.0.5.jar;&quot; JDBC_Demo &gt; output.txt </font></p>
<p><b>Option C. Running the demo using a batch file.</b> Download
<a href="JDBC/JDBC_Demo.bat.txt">JDBC_Demo.bat.txt</a> and store it in the 
working folders with other files. Edit the path and class path variables in the 
same manner as Option C in Section C. After saving the .bat file and removing 
the &quot;.txt&quot; suffix from its name, double click on it to run. The file
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">JDBC_Demo_Output.txt</span> congaing the expected output will be created. 
Store this file in folder P0. </p>
<hr>
<h3>E. Demo to test Schema-awareness of Saxon XQuery engine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
<hr>
<p align="left">Note that with the consent of Saxonica, their XQuery engine is 
included and configured to work in CyDIW under the &quot;$Saxon:&gt;&quot; prefix. With the 
included version, a light version of Saxon is invoked. In order to use the id(.) 
function, needed for Project 3, the Enterprise version has to be invoked. Then run the 
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ComS363_Test_ID_Function_in_XQuery(Saxon).txt</span> batch file in the ComS363 
folder. Save the output in the file <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
ComS363_Test_ID_Function_in_XQuery(Saxon)_Output.htm</span> in folder P0.
