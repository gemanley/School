		<h3>Reporting bugs</h3>
		<p>In order to improve GHDL, we welcome bugs report and suggestions for any aspect of GHDL. Please email them to <a href="mailto:ghdl@free.fr">ghdl@free.fr</a>.</p>
		<p>If the compiler crashes, this is a bug. Reliable tools never crash.</p>
		<p>If your compiled VHDL executable crashes, this may be a bug at run time or the code produced may be wrong. However, since VHDL has a notion of pointers, an erroneous VHDL program (using invalid pointers for example) may crash.</p>
		<p>If the compiler emits an error message for a perfectly valid input or does not emit an error message for an invalid input, this may be a bug. Please send the input file and what you expected. If you know the LRM well enough, please specify the paragraph which has not been well implemented. If you don't know the LRM, maybe your bug report will be rejected simply because there is no bug. In the latter case, it may be difficult to discuss the issue; and comparisons with other VHDL tools is not a very strong argument.</p>
		<p>If a compiler message is not clear enough for you, please tell me. The error messages can be improved, but I have not enough experience with them.</p>
		<p>If you have found a mistake in the manual, please send a comment. If you have not understood some parts of this manual, please tell me. English is not my mother tongue, so this manual may not be well-written. Again, rewriting part of it is a good way to improve it.</p>
		<p>If you send a <code>VHDL</code> file producing a bug, it is a good idea to try to make it as short as possible. It is also a good idea to make it looking like a test: write a comment which explains wether the file should compile, and if yes, whether or not it should run successfully. In the latter case, an assert statement should finish the test; the severity level note indicates success, while a severity level failure indicates failure.</p>
		<p>For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the problem. This includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the version of <code>GHDL</code> (you can get it with <code>ghdl --version</code>).
			<li>the operating system
			<li>whether you have built <code>GHDL</code> from sources or used the binary distribution.
			<li>the content of the input files
			<li>a description of the problem and samples of any erroneous input
			<li>anything else that you think would be helpful.
		</ul>
