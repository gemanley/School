		<h4>Restrictions on foreign declarations</h4>
		<p>Any subprogram can be imported. GHDL puts no restrictions on foreign subprograms. However, the representation of a type or of an interface in a foreign language may be obscur. Most of non-composite types are easily imported:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><code>integer types</code>
			<dd>They are represented on a 32 bits word. This generally corresponds to <code>int</code> for <code>C</code> or <code>Integer</code> for <code>Ada</code>.<br>
			<dt><code>physical types</code>
			<dd>They are represented on a 64 bits word. This generally corresponds to the <code>long long</code> for <code>C</code> or <code>Long_Long_Integer</code> for <code>Ada</code>.<br>
			<dt><code>floating point types</code>
			<dd>They are represented on a 64 bits floating point word. This generally corresponds to <code>double</code> for <code>C</code> or <code>Long_Float</code> for <code>Ada</code>.<br>
			<dt><code>enumeration types</code>
			<dd>They are represented on 8 bits or 32 bits word, if the number of literals is greater than 256. There is no corresponding C types, since arguments are not promoted.
		</dl>
		<p>Non-composite types are passed by value. For the <code>in</code> mode, this corresponds to the <code>C</code> or <code>Ada</code> mechanism. The <code>out</code> and <code>inout</code> interfaces of non-composite types are gathered in a record and this record is passed by reference as the first argument to the subprogram. As a consequence, you shouldn't use <code>in</code> and <code>inout</code> modes in foreign subprograms, since they are not portable.</p>
		<p>Records are represented like a <code>C</code> structure and are passed by reference to subprograms.</p>
		<p>Arrays with static bounds are represented like a <code>C</code> array, whose length is the number of elements, and are passed by reference to subprograms.</p>
		<p>Unconstrained array are represented by a fat pointer. Do not use unconstrained arrays in foreign subprograms.</p>
		<p>Accesses to an unconstrained array is a fat pointer. Other accesses corresponds a an address and are passed to a subprogram like other non-composite types.</p>
		<p>Files are represented by a 32 bits word, which corresponds to an index in a table.</p>
