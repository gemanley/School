		<h3>Source representation</h3>
		<p>According to the VHDL standard, design units (i.e. entities, architectures, packages, package bodies and configurations) may be independently analyzed.</p>
		<p>Several design units may be grouped into a design file.</p>
		<p>In GHDL, a system file represents a design file. That is, a file compiled by GHDL may contain one or more design units.</p>
		<p>It is common to have several design units in a design file.</p>
		<p>GHDL does not impose any restriction on the name of a design file (except that the file name may not contain any control character or spaces).</p>
		<p>GHDL do not keep a binary representation of the design units analyzed like other VHDL analyzers. The sources of the design units are re-read when needed (for example, an entity is re-read when one of its architecture is analyzed). Therefore, if you delete or modify a source file of a unit analyzed, GHDL will refuse to use it.</p>
