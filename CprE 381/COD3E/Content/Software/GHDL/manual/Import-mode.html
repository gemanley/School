		<h4>Import mode</h4>
		<p>Add files in the work design library.<br>
		</p>
		<pre>$ ghdl -i [<var>options</var>] <var>file</var><small>...</small>
</pre>
		<p>All the files specified in the command line are scanned, parsed and added in the libraries but as not yet analyzed. No object files are created.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this mode is to localize design units in the design files. The make mode will then be able to recursively build a hierarchy from an entity name or a configuration name.</p>
		<p>Since the files are parsed, there must be correct files. However, since they are not analyzed, many errors are tolerated in this mode.</p>
		<p>Note that all the files are added in the work library. If you have many libraries, you must use the command for each library.</p>
		<p>See <a href="Make-mode.html#Make%20mode">Make mode</a>, to actually build the design.</p>
