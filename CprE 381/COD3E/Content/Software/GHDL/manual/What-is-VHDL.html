		<h3>What is <code>VHDL</code>?</h3>
		<p><dfn>VHDL</dfn> is an acronym for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language which is a programming language used to describe a logic circuit by function, data flow behaviour, or structure.</p>
		<p><code>VHDL</code> <em>is</em> a programming language: although <code>VHDL</code> was not designed for writing general purpose programs, you can write any algorithm with the <code>VHDL</code> language. If you are able to write programs, you will find in <code>VHDL</code> features similar to those found in procedural languages such as <code>C</code>, <code>Pascal</code> or <code>Ada</code>. <code>VHDL</code> derives most of its syntax and semantics from <code>Ada</code>. Knowing <code>Ada</code> is an advantage for learning <code>VHDL</code> (it is an advantage in general as well).</p>
		<p>However, <code>VHDL</code> was not designed as a general purpose language but as an <code>HDL</code> (hardware description language). As the name implies, <code>VHDL</code> aims at modeling or documenting electronics systems. Due to the nature of hardware components which are always running, <code>VHDL</code> is a highly concurrent language, built upon an event-based timing model.</p>
		<p>Like a program written in any other language, a <code>VHDL</code> program can be executed. Since <code>VHDL</code> is used to model designs, the term <dfn>simulation</dfn> is often used instead of <dfn>execution</dfn>, with the same meaning.</p>
		<p>Like a program written in another hardware description language, a <code>VHDL</code> program can be transformed with a <code>synthesis tool</code> into a netlist, that is, a detailed gate-level implementation.</p>
