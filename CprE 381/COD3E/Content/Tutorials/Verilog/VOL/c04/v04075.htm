					<td>The standard way of thinking of strength levels is as a range:
						<p></p>
						<center>
							<img src="images/v0422g1.gif" height="97" width="470"></center>
						<p>A signal driven by a primitive has a single value from this set. The default driving strength is strong (<font size="3" face="courier">St0</font> and <font size="3" face="courier">St1</font>). When a signal comes from a gate, it may be blended with other drivers on the same net by a resolution function, which takes the values of all the drivers and determines the value of the net.</p>
						<p>If all of the drivers have values in the 0 part of the table, or all of them drive values in the 1 part of the table, the value is known, and is 0 or 1 respectively. A signal which has a single strength value is an unambiguous signal, and one with more than one value from the table is an ambiguous signal (for example, <font size="3" face="courier">Pu1</font> and <font size="3" face="courier">St1</font>).</p>
