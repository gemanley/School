					<td width="375">User-defined primitives, or UDPs, are customized logic functions. This is a powerful way to define your own primitive logic operation with up to 10 inputs and a single output. Logic functions defined as UDPs are very efficient, because their evaluation requires only a single table lookup.
						<p>Historically, UDPs were added to the language in order to improve the efficiency of gate-level simulation. They did this by exposing the underlying gate evaluation mechanism for the built-in primitives (and, or, xor, etc.), which is a simple table lookup. In general, UDPs are good to use in all Verilog simulation implementations. UDPs are found mostly in libraries.</p>
