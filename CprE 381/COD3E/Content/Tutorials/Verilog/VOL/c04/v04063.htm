				<td width="600">As described in Chapter 3 (see section on Multiple Delays), built-in primitives can take either 2 delay values or 3 delay values, depending on the primitive. (Pullup and Pulldown do not allow any delay specification.)
					<p>The delay simply means that if a gate input changes value at time <b>t</b>, the gate output will change value at time <b>t+d</b>. Delays which are attached to each primitive in the netlist are called <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#didelay')"><font color="#B22222"><b>distributed delays</b></font></a></font>, because they are distributed throughout the circuit.</p>
					<p>While delays can be specified on built-in primitives (and user-defined primitives), they cannot be specified on arbitrary modules. This is primarily because primitives have a simple, direct relationship between inputs and output(s), but normal modules do not. Therefore, if you want to associate delays with the outputs of a module, you must put the delays on the output drivers, either primitive or continuous assignment.</p>
					<p>Primitive delays work like this:</p>

					<p>The gate in the figure has a delay of d, which causes the output to lag the input by d time units.</p>
