					<td>MOS switches are supposed to model PMOS and NMOS transistors. Each one has a resistive variation (the name begins with &quot;r&quot;) which reduces the strength of the signals which propagate through them. The four primitives nmos, pmos, rnmos, and rpmos have behavior which is similar to bufif0 and bufif1, as shown by the following tables:

						<p>The behavior of rpmos is the same as pmos, and rnmos is the same as nmos, with the only caveat being that the strength of the data value is reduced one level in the &quot;r&quot; version. That is, if the data input is strong1, then the output will be pull1 if the control input is the appropriate value.</p>
