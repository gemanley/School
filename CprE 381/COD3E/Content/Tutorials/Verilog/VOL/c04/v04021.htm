				<td>The ports in the definition may be port expressions. The following are legal port lists in definition statements:
					<p></p>
					<pre>
module foo (port1, port2[1455], port3[3:7], 
       {port4_bit1, port4_bit2, port4_bit3});

module bar (.port1(int1), .port2(int2[1455]), .port3(int3[3:7]),
       .port4({bit1, bit2, bit3}));
</pre>
					The use of expressions in the definition is questionable practice at best, and most of the time it is downright obscure. While you can make a case for using concatenations -- it is a convenient way of breaking out bit fields from a vector -- using a bit-select or part-select in a port definition is not recommended.
					<p>Likewise, using the .portid(id) notation in the definition is not common practice. You don't need to define ports this way in order to refer to them in the instantiation by name, so it usually isn't done.</p>
