					<td valign="top" width="390">Most models written in Verilog are either behavioral, RTL, or gate level. The distinction between them lies in how much use is made of procedural constructs. However, there is another level, lower than gate level, which is the switch level. Switch-level models are netlist models made up of <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#sprimitives')"><font color="#B22222">switch primitives</font></a> and nets which have strength values. These models can represent individual transistors and capacitors.</td>
