		<font size="3" face="Times">A &quot;signal&quot; is not a formal Verilog term, but we use it in a general way to mean something that has a value, such as a wire or a reg. The value a signal may take is either 0, 1, x, z, or a drive strength value. (Drive strength is covered later in this chapter.) </font>
