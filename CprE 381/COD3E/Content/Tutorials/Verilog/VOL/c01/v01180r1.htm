				There may be more than one driver on a net. If there is more than one driver, the value of the net is determined by a resolution function. In Verilog, the possible resolution functions are built-in. Which resolution function is used is determined by the net type. For example, a net declared as wand has an and resolution function.
				<p>Each bit in a net can take on one of four values: 0, 1, x, or z. In addition, nets can have different driving strengths. That is, a net can be connected to a driver which has weak or strong driving strength.</p>
