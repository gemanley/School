The declaration may occur anywhere within the module, but it may not be nested within procedural blocks. The declaration does not have to precede the task or function invocation.
					<p>Tasks may only be used in procedural blocks. A task invocation, or task enable as it is called in Verilog, is a statement by itself. It may not be used as an operand in an expression.</p>
					<p>Functions are used as operands in expressions. A function may be used in either a procedural block or a continuous assignment, or indeed, any place where an expression may appear.</p>
