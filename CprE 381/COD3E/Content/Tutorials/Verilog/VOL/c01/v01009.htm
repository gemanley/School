					<p>The principal feature of a hardware description language is that it contains the capability to describe the function of a piece of hardware independently of the implementation. The great advance with modern HDLs was the recognition that a single language could be used to describe the function of the design and also to describe the implementation. This allows the entire design process to take place in a single language, and thus a single representation of the design.</FONT></p>
