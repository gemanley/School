			<tr>Many people feel strongly that named port assignments are &quot;better&quot; than positional port assignments. When you have a module, corresponding to the top level of a large ASIC which has 600 pins, it is definitely easier to get the port connections right if they each have a name. However, it is roughly twice as much typing (and, more importantly, reading). The fact is, most Verilog code is written with positional port assignments.
