						<a name="1986"><b><u>1986 - Verilog-XL</u></b>
							<p>The first major extension to the language was Verilog-XL, which added a few features and implemented the infamous &quot;XL algorithm,&quot; a very efficient method for doing gate-level simulation. This occured in 1986, and marked the beginning of Verilog's growth period. Many leading-edge electronic designers began using Verilog at this time because it was fast at gate level simulation, and had the capabilities to model at higher levels of abstraction. These users began to do full system simulation of their designs, where the actual logic being designed was represented by a netlist and other parts of the system were modelled behaviorally.</p>

							<p>In 1988, Synopsys delivered the first logic synthesizer which used Verilog as an input language. This was a major event, as now the top-down design methodology could actually be used effectively. The design could be done at the &quot;register transfer level&quot;, and then Synopsys' Design Compiler could translate that into gates. With this event, the use of Verilog increased dramatically.</p>

							<p>Beginning in 1989, another major trend began to emerge, the use of Verilog-XL for sign-off certification by ASIC vendors. As Verilog became popular with the semiconductor vendor's customers, they began to move away from their own, proprietary simulators, and started allowing customers to simulate using Verilog-XL for timing certification. As more ASIC vendors certified Verilog-XL, they requested more features, especially related to timing checks, back annotation, and delay specification. In response, Gateway implemented many new features in the language and the simulator to accommodate this need.</p>
							<p>Cadence Design Systems acquired Gateway in December 1989, and continued to market Verilog as both a language and a simulator. At the same time, Synopsys was marketing the top-down design methodology, using Verilog. This was a powerful combination.</p>

							<p>From its inception through the end of the 1980s, Verilog was a proprietary language. No other vendors were allowed to make a Verilog simulator. In response, the other CAE vendors put their weight behind the VHDL standardization process which had been started by the DoD in the early 1980's. They needed a comparable product to sell, and VHDL was the only viable alternative.</p>
							<p>By 1990, Cadence recognized that if Verilog remained a closed language, the pressures of standardization would eventually cause the industry to shift to VHDL. Consequently, Cadence organized Open Verilog International (OVI), and in 1991 gave it the documentation for the Verilog Hardware Description Language. This was the event which &quot;opened&quot; the language. Subsequently, OVI did a considerable amount of work to improve the Language Reference Manual (LRM), clarifying things and making the language specification as vendor-independent as possible.</p>
							<p>In 1994, the IEEE 1364 working group was formed to turn the OVI LRM into an IEEE standard. This effort was concluded with a successful ballot in 1995, and Verilog became an IEEE standard in December, 1995.</p>

							<p>When Cadence gave OVI the LRM, several companies began working on Verilog simulators. In 1992, the first of these were announced, and by 1993 there were several Verilog simulators available from companies other than Cadence. The most successful of these was VCS, the Verilog Compiled Simulator, from Chronologic Simulation. This was a true compiler as opposed to an interpreter, which is what Verilog-XL was. As a result, compile time was substantial, but simulation execution speed was much faster. Now, Verilog simulators are available for most computers at a variety of prices, and which have a variety of performance characteristics and features. Verilog is more heavily used than ever, and it is growing faster than any other hardware description language. It has truly become the standard hardware description language.</p>
