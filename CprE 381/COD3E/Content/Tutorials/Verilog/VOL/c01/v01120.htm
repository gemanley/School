				<td>The primary rule with continuous assignments is that the left-hand side must be a net. The reason for this rule is that registers get values at discrete times, but nets are always driven by a value. Changes to a net may happen asynchronously, any time anything on the right-hand side changes, the left-hand side may change its value.</td>
