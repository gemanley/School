		<font size="3" face="Times">A common error is to connect a signal which is supposed to be an input to an output port. Because Verilog is so flexible with regard to connecting ports, this will usually not be caught until simulation time, when a wire has two drivers on it when it should only have one, or when a wire has no drivers on it. These errors can be difficult to track down.</font>
