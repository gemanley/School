					Nets are driven by <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#netd')"><font color="#B22222">net drivers</font></a>. Drivers may be

						<li>output port of a module instance<br>

					</ul>
					There may be more than one <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#driver')"><font color="#B22222">driver</font></a> on a net. If there is more than one driver, the value of the net is determined by a resolution function. In Verilog, the possible resolution functions are built-in. Which resolution function is used is determined by the net type. For example, a net declared as <u>wand</u> has an <u>and</u> resolution function.
					<p>Each bit in a net can take on one of four values: 0, 1, x, or z. In addition, nets can have different driving strengths. That is, a net can be connected to a driver which has weak or strong driving strength.</p>
