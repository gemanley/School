				<td>There may be many initial and always blocks in a module. Since there may be many modules in a model, there may be many initial and always blocks in the entire model. All of them begin execution at time 0. However, there is no defined order between them. There is no guarantee that any statement will execute before or after any other statement which is not in the same block unless there is a time or event control to establish that relationship.
