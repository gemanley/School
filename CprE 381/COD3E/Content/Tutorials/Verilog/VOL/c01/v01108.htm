				<td>The built-in primitives are very straight-forward. The output port is listed first, and the input ports are listed last. The <font size="3" face="courier">and, or,</font> and <font size="3" face="courier">xor</font> primitives each have one output and may have as many input ports as desired. The <font size="3" face="courier">buf</font> and <font size="3" face="courier">not</font> primitives have as many output ports as desired, and only one input. Another difference between built-in primitives and other instances is that a built-in primitive may be instantiated without an instance name.
					<p>It is quite possible to have a module defined completely in terms of built-in primitives.</p>
