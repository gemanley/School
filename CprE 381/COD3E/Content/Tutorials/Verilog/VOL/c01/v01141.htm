				<td>Always blocks also begin at time 0. The only difference between an always block and an initial block is that when the always statement finishes execution, it starts executing again. Note that if there is no time or event control in the always block, simulation time can never advance beyond time 0. Example,
					<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#10 clock = ~clock; </tt></p>
