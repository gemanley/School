			<tr>It is often surprising that a Verilog simulator will not tell you when you made an error in port assignment. There are several reasons for this. The most common error is to leave out a port assignment. However, since this is legal, the simulator can't tell that you didn't intend to do it. The usual consequence of omitting a port assignment is that succeeding assignments are made to the wrong signals. Sometimes this can look like an error, for instance if the sizes mis-match, but often even that will be legal, though not what you want.
