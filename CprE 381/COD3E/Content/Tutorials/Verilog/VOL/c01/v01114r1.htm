				Scalar nets can have different strength levels. A strength level is associated with each driver on the net. If a strength is not specified, then the default for that driver is used. The usual default is &quot;strong&quot;. The net itself takes on a value which is a combination of all the drivers on it, according to a set of rules. Driving strength is covered in more detail later in this chapter.</font></b>
