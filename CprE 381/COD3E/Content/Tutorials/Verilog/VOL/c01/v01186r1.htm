A module can have as many procedural blocks as necessary. These blocks are sequences of executable statements. The statements in each block are executed sequentially, but the blocks themselves are concurrent and asynchronous to other blocks.<p>
		There are two types of procedural blocks, initial blocks and always blocks.

		<p></font>All initial and always blocks contain a single statement, which may be a compound statement, e.g.</p>
