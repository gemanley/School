				<td>Scalars are the fundamental type in Verilog. Ultimately, hardware is built up out of single-bit constructions.
					<p>A scalar can have one of 0, 1, x, or z as its value. This is the familiar 4-value set. Scalars are not restricted to just these four values, however. A scalar value can be one of a range of 120 different possible values, which represent different strength levels of the signal.</p>

			You can assign a scalar value to a single bit of a vector, but they do not have the same representational ability. That is, if the scalar has a value other than 0, 1, x, or z, the value will be converted to one of the 4-value set before being stored to the bit of the vector.
