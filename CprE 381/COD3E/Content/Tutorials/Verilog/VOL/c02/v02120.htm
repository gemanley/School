				<td>Another limitation on memory access is that you can't take a bit-select or part-select of a memory element. Thus, if you want to get the 3rd bit out of the 10th element of a memory, you need to do it in two steps:
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>reg [0:31] temp, mem[1:1024];<br>
						<dd>...<br>
						<dd>temp = mem[10];<br>
						<dd>bit = temp[3];
							<p></p>
					</dl>
					</TT>Note that while you can use a memory index operand on the right-hand side of a continuous assignment, this is not very good practice. The reason is that some implementations of Verilog treat a change in value to any element in the memory as indistinguishable from any other, so the right-hand side expression in a continuous assignment would get re-evaluated whenever any element of the memory changed, not just when the desired element changed.
					<p>Just like bit-selects, if the memory index is x or z, then the result of a memory access with that index is x.</p>
