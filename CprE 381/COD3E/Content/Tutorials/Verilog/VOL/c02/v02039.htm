				<td width="600">A string constant is a sequence of characters enclosed in &quot; (double quotes). String constants may be used whereever a vector is allowed, and, in general, is equivalent to a vector whose width is 8 times the number of characters in the string. The value of the vector is the same as if the ASCII values of each character were concatenated.
					<p>For example,</p>
					<p></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>&quot;Hello World&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is represented as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88'h48656c6c6f_20_576f726c64
					</dl>
					Strings may be assigned to vectors, or used with operators in expressions. They are most commonly used as arguments to <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#stask')"><font color="#B22222">system tasks</font></a> (like $display). Note that, though you can use a string constant whereever a vector is allowed, the reverse is not true. That is, you cannot put a format string into a variable and use that in a $display task invocation. (You can do it, it just won't do what you would expect.)</td>
