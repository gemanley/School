				<td>A memory element is accessed by means of a memory index operation. A memory index looks just like a bit-select:<br>
					<dl>
						<tt>
						<dd>mem[index]</tt>
					</dl>
					</TT>You can use a memory index as an operand in an expression, or you can use it on the left-hand side of an assignment in a procedural assignment statement. You can't use a memory index on the left-hand side of a continuous assignment.
					<p>Note that you cannot use a memory identifier on the left-hand side of an assignment. This is another way of saying that you can't assign a whole memory in one operation.</p>
