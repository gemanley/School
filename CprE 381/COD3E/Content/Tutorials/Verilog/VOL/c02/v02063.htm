				<td width="530">Source macros are a special case of a general class of statements called compiler directives. A Verilog source macro is very similar to the source macro facility in C which is implemented by the C preprocessor. In Verilog, the source macro is defined by means of a `define statement. Notice that the first character is &quot;`&quot;, the back-quote.
					<p>An identifier is defined as a macro by associating a string of text to be substituted whenever the macro identifier is used. Macro identifiers are marked in the text by preceding them with the &quot;`&quot; (back-quote again). For example,</p>
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>`define mymacro this is some text<br>
						<dd>...<br>
						<dd>$display(&quot;`mymacro&quot;);<br>
						<dd>...<br>
							</TT>
					</dl>
					This would print the string
					<p></p>
					<dl>
						<dd><tt>this is some text</tt>
					</dl>
