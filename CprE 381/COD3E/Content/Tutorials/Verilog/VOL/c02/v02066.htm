				<td>Note that there is no trailing semi-colon in the macro definition. If there was, it would be included in the macro text to be substituted. It is possible to have a macro invocation within the macro text definition.
					<p>Macro definitions are global, and are text-order dependent. That is, the definition must appear before it is used, but the macro may be used in any module which appears in the source stream thereafter. It is possible to redefine a macro, and the new definition overrides the old one for all subsequent uses.</p>
					<p>Macro definitions may appear anywhere in the source stream, both within and outside of module definitions. A macro definition remains in effect for the remainder of the source stream, or until the macro is redefined.</p>
