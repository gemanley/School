				<td>The language is made up of statements, groups of statements, and keywords to identify the different types of statement groups.
					<p>These are properties of Verilog statements:</p>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Statements are composed of tokens.
						<li>Statements can be continued across line boundaries, but individual tokens cannot.
						<li>Statements within a given group are usually separated by &quot;;&quot;, but statement groups are usually not separated by &quot;;&quot;.
						<li>In general, the &quot;;&quot; is a statement separator, not a terminator.
					</ul>
					<p>Verilog syntax appears to be something of a cross between C and Pascal.</p>
