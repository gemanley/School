			<td width="600">Now, we'll proceed to Stage 3 of the Edit-Compile-Debug process, finding the first error. The edit-compile-debug process is usually thought of as an interactive process. However, the debug step includes running the simulation for a perhaps long time, and this may be done either interactively or non-interactively. Thus, finding the occurence of the first error may be non-trivial.
				<p>There are several general techniques for finding the error, and these are appropriate for different parts of the development cycle. Click each to find out more about it.</p>

				You run the model, either interactively or not, and observe the output. If it is incorrect, you stop the model and investigate. If the model was run non-interactively, you run it again interactively and stop it when it has the problem (at least you know when the incorrect output was produced). When you run the model again, you may enable diagnostic output (like $dumpvars) that was disabled before. This is used after the model works well enough to run for a while, but is not a great technique when errors occur after long simulation runs.</td>
