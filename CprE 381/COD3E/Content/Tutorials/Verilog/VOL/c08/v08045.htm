Ideally, the model stops the simulation and says, &quot;an error ocurred at cycle 153401 because signal busen3 was enabled when it should not have been&quot;. If it also dumps out enough of the internal state and local history to tell why the offending signal was wrong, then no further debugging is required. Unfortunately, it is rare that you anticipate the bugs well enough to supply all of the needed information.</td>
