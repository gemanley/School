			<td width="600">The process of debugging a Verilog model usually follows the following stages. Click each stage to learn more about it.
				<p>1. <a href="a08009.htm">Edit the Source</a><br>
					2. <a href="b08009.htm">Compile the Model</a><br>
					3. <a href="c08009.htm">Run the Simulation Until the First Error Occurs</a><br>
					4. <a href="d08009.htm">Debug the Problem</a><br>
					5. <a href="e08009.htm">Repeat the Process</a></p>
				<p>This is often not thought of as a separate step when you are running an interpretive simulator like Verilog-XL. However, the compile step is significant even for interpretive simulators, and its progress is usually indicated by information messages. The model must be compiled before simulation can begin. With a compiled simulator like VCS, compilation is a separate command, and may be quite lengthy.</p>
