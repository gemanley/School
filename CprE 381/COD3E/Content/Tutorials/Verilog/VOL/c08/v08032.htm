			<td width="600">Waveforms can be very useful, but they are a very low level of data representation. For example, if the model is a processor, it treats data as instructions made up of different fields. It would convey more information to display the state as instructions in execution than as a set of control bits and data values.
				<p>Unfortunately, there is not much generality in displaying data at a higher level of abstraction, since the level of abstraction is inherently model-dependent. This means that, to do something effective, you have to write the code yourself. Fortunately, the PLI gives you the capability to write programs which can display simulation results and hook them up to the simulation model. For example, it is quite possible to write a C program to draw a picture in an X-window which depicts the simulated model results. This has been done to display the pictures which would be rendered by graphics hardware which was being simulated.</p>
