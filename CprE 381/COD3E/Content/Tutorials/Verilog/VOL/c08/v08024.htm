			<td width="600">Now, we'll proceed to Stage 3 of the Edit-Compile-Debug process, finding the first error. The edit-compile-debug process is usually thought of as an interactive process. However, the debug step includes running the simulation for a perhaps long time, and this may be done either interactively or non-interactively. Thus, finding the occurence of the first error may be non-trivial.
				<p>There are several general techniques for finding the error, and these are appropriate for different parts of the development cycle. Click each to find out more about it.</p>
