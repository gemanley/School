			<td width="600">An alternative is to simply dump a history of all signal changes into a VCD file (or equivalent) for each regression test. Then, if a test is flagged as being in error, all the information is available, and can be examined with a post-processing viewer. The problem with this approach, of course, is that saving the history files for every regression run would be prohibitive due to disk space requirements. Even saving the complete history of a single regression test could require gigabytes of storage.</td>
