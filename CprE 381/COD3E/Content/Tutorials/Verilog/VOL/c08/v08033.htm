			<td width="425">Once the what of the problem has been identified, you have to identify the why. Thus you move on to Stage 4, debugging the problem. Most of the specific features for exposing the workings of a model are specific to particular simulator implementations. There are, however, some capabilities that are inherent in the language, and some nearly universal features found in simulator implementations. In addition, there are commercial products which provide debugging capabilities that work together with the simulator.
				<p>The primary debugging technique is to display information from the model while it simulates, and then analyze the output for incorrect behavior. Of course, this is easy to say but often difficult to do. Analysis of the model results can be done interactively or after-the-fact. As long as there is enough information, both ways are equally difficult.</p>
