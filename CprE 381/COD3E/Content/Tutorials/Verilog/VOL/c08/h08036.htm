			<td width="600">Most simulators have interactive capabilities. Using these features, one can run a simulation, stop when the problem is manifest (or suspected), and expose the workings of the model sufficiently to diagnose the problem. In general, the interactive interface to the simulator is called the Command Line Interface, or <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#cli')"><font color="#B22222">CLI</font></a>. Most simulators have their own CLI, each somewhat different from the others. However, most of them provide the same capabilities. Click each feature to learn more about it.</td>

			<td valign="TOP" width="400">One of the most asked questions is &quot;why does this signal have this value?&quot; For a net, this question is easy to answer. The simulator knows what the drivers are, and what their values are. The system task $showvars is the way it can tell you. This is a system task because it can be used in the model source in many simulator implementations.</td>
