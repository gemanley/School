			<td width="600">It is most often the case that when a change has been made to a model, only a small number of modules, and thus files, are changed. It would be desirable to recompile only the changed parts.
				<p>In theory, it is not possible to avoid reading the entire model source before compiling for simulation. However, it is possible to read the entire source, and then make a decision as to what modules have changed, and only compile those modules. There is at least one commercial simulator implementation which does this (VCS). It is not as clean as a C compiler, because it must save a great deal of information, but it is effective. If you use VCS, you should make it a habit to use the <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#incremental')"><font color="#B22222">incremental compilation</font></a> option.</p>
