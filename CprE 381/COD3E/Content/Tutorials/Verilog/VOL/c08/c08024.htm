			<td width="600">Now, we'll proceed to Stage 3 of the Edit-Compile-Debug process, finding the first error. The edit-compile-debug process is usually thought of as an interactive process. However, the debug step includes running the simulation for a perhaps long time, and this may be done either interactively or non-interactively. Thus, finding the occurence of the first error may be non-trivial.
				<p>There are several general techniques for finding the error, and these are appropriate for different parts of the development cycle. Click each to find out more about it.</p>

				This is a very effective method. The model contains code which checks assertions about the model state. There may be many such assertions in the model. For example, there may be an assertion that only one bus enable may be on at any given time. There may be another assertion that there must be at least one idle cycle after the initiation of a read transaction on the bus. This is a very good technique for identifying errors, as an assertion failure is usually very specific.</td>
