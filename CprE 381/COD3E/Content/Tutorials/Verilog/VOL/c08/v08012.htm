			<td valign="top" width="425">Verilog has several features which are consequences of the first simulator implementation (Verilog-XL). These include the way source macros are global, relying on text order, and the ability to modify parameters arbitrarily throughout the design using the defparam statement.
				<p>These features require a Verilog <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#compiler')"><font color="#B22222">compiler</font></a> to read the entire model source in order to compile it correctly. (This is in contrast to a C compiler, for example, which can compile different source files independently.)</p>
				<p>When you run a Verilog simulator, you will generally see informative comments like:</p>
				<p></p>
				<dl>
					<dd>Compiling source file &quot;foo.v&quot;
				</dl>
				<p>This shows you that it is compiling, and the order it is processing the files in. The order can be useful when tracking down problems with macro definitions being in effect across file boundaries.</p>
