			<td width="600">Traditionally, Verilog simulators (i.e. Verilog-XL and VCS) did not incorporate graphical user interfaces. The user interface for these simulators was command-line oriented. This is most appropriate for large-scale, non-interactive simulation which is how most late-stage simulation is characterized.
				<p>However, for model development, it is often the case that interactive use is effective, and a graphical interface can enhance the effectiveness. Several commercial products have been created to fill this need. The most popular ones are SignalScan, VirSim, Undertow, and Debussy.</p>
				<p>All of these products originated as waveform viewers which read VCD files and displayed waveforms of signals. They were then enhanced to add source display capabilities and then simulation control features. Because these things could be done through the standard PLI, these products are more or less common for the different simulators. That is, you can use one user interface program with several different simulators.</p>
				<p>Now there is a rich variety of features available from these products, and new features are being added continually. Some common features are:</p>
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>start and control the simulation
					<li>set breakpoints
					<li>display signals both graphically and textually
					<li>display a schematic representation of parts of the model
					<li>trace signal fan-in and fan-out
					<li>display the model hierarchy
					<li>display the signals in each instance
					<li>display the source
				</ul>
