			<td width="600">The process of debugging a Verilog model usually follows the following stages. Click each stage to learn more about it.
				<p>1. <a href="a08009.htm">Edit the Source</a><br>
					2. <a href="b08009.htm">Compile the Model</a><br>
					3. <a href="c08009.htm">Run the Simulation Until the First Error Occurs</a><br>
					4. <a href="d08009.htm">Debug the Problem</a><br>
					5. <a href="e08009.htm">Repeat the Process</a></p>
				<p>Once the simulation exposes an error, the problem must be debugged. Once an error occurs, simulation may stop immediately due to internal checking, or the simulation may run for a long time before you gain control. If the simulation was run non-interactively, you must simply rely on whatever output may have been produced by the simulation to debug the problem.</p>
