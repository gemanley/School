			<td width="345">As the design matures, it takes more and more simulation to expose new errors. This is not conducive to interactive debugging. Typically, a simulation model is run on a regression suite of tests (stimulus) which grows during the life of the design project. By the later stages, the regression suite can encompass tests which run for days, weeks, and even months of simulation time. Running such large regression tests is inherently non-interactive. Typically, a large number of processors will be devoted to running the regression tests continuously. Each time a test finishes, its results would be automatically analyzed to see if they were correct (or at least, what was expected for that test), and if the results were incorrect, then it would be flagged for further analysis.</td>
