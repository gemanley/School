			<td width="600">Displaying signals from the model as waveforms is a common practice, and can be a very useful way of visualizing the operation of a model. This is not a standard feature of the language, but it is a simulator implementation feature. Interestingly, displaying waveforms is a relatively late addition to Verilog simulators, and as a result, the normal way of displaying waveforms is not by the simulator at all but by means of a separate program which reads and interprets a history file (the VCD file).
				<p>There are several commercially available waveform viewers, Debussy, SignalScan, VirSim, and Undertow among them, which can read and display VCD files, as well as a number of locally-written viewers. These waveform viewers have evolved from simple display programs to quite comprehensive simulation interfaces.</p>
				<p>As they have evolved, they have all created their own history file formats which contain more information than the standard VCD file format. In each, you have to use a specific variation of the $dumpvars system task in order to dump the appropriate information into the new history file.</p>
				<p>All we will say here about these products is that in general they are quite good, offering good functionality at reasonable prices. Each has distinguishing features from the others.</p>
