			<td width="600">Most simulators have interactive capabilities. Using these features, one can run a simulation, stop when the problem is manifest (or suspected), and expose the workings of the model sufficiently to diagnose the problem. In general, the interactive interface to the simulator is called the Command Line Interface, or <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#cli')"><font color="#B22222">CLI</font></a>. Most simulators have their own CLI, each somewhat different from the others. However, most of them provide the same capabilities. Click each feature to learn more about it.</td>

			<td valign="TOP" width="400">When referencing nets and registers in a model from the CLI, it is generally necessary to use hierarchical names, just as you would in cross-module references. The $scope system task is a CLI command which changes the command line context. Using this, one can reference nets and registers within a module instance by using their local names instead of their fully qualified names.</td>
