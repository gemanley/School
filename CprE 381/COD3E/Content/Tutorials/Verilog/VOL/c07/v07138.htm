				<p><a href="javascript:parent.gotoScreen('07','144',1)">Local Interrupt Controller</a><br>
					This is a model of a state machine and the data path it controls which manages an interrupt protocol on a bus. This model comes from NeXT computer, and was in fact part of a computer which was produced (but never sold). It is used by kind permission of Firepower, Inc.</p>
				<p><a href="javascript:parent.gotoScreen('07','147',1)">Limit Counter</a><br>
					This is a counter which has an up and down mode, along with a limit. There is a reset function and a load limit function. When the counter reaches the limit, either up or down, it stops and holds its value. We present two versions here, one faster (and better style) than the other.</p>
