			Clock circuits often use a flip-flop to store the state in. The flip-flop is usually a module which comes from a library, and it may be defined at gate, RTL, or behavioral levels. If it is defined at a gate level, then the problem is the same as discussed above. If, however, it is defined procedurally, then the initial state may be overridden by a force or QCA.
