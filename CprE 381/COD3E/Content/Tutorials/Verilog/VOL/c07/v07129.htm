			<td valign="top" width="335">Other very expensive features in Verilog are the bi-direct primitives tran, rtran, tranif, and rtranif. When these primitives are used, the nets used in their ports must include resolution functions that can determine what the value of the net should be in the face of multiple drivers, each of which may affect the other.
				<p>The usual algorithm for computing these resolution functions is called a relaxation method, and it involves iteratively solving a set of equations. As you might imagine, this is quite expensive.</p>
