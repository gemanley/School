				Another type of race condition does not involve sampling a signal, but involves two concurrent updates of a signal. The simplest example of this type of race is:
				<pre>
    initial #1 x = 1;
    initial #1 x = 0;
</pre>
				It is pretty obvious that this is an indeterminate situation. It is not so obvious that it remains indeterminate if the assignments were replaced with non-blocking assignments.</td>
