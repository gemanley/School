			<td valign="top" width="600">It is more interesting if there is some combinational logic associated with each pipe stage. Suppose each stage has some logic represented by a function f1, f2, f3 which is applied to the input.
				<p><img src="images/v0724g1.gif" height="83" width="499"></p>
				<p>Then, the pipeline might look like this:</p>
				<p></p>
				<pre>
module pipeline (out, in, clock);
    output out;
    input  in, clock;
    wire   s1out, s2out, s1in, s2in, s3in;
    
    assign s1in = f1(in),
           s2in = f2(s1out),
           s3in = f3(s2out);
    
    pipestage s1  (s1out, s1in, clock),
              s2  (s2out, s2in, clock),
              s3  (out,   s3in, clock);
endmodule
</pre>
				Notice that there is no need to put a delay on the continuous assignments, because the delay is done in the pipestage module (using the NBA). Alternatively, one could make the pipestage delay-less and put a delay on the continuous assignments.</td>
