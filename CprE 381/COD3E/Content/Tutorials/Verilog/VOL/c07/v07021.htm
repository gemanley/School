			<td valign="top" width="345">The problem with all of the clock modelling methods presented so far is how does the clock get started? Remember that the output of all net drivers is initially x, which means that if a net is connected to any drivers at all, its initial value is x. Registers also start out as x until a procedural assignment is made to them.
				<p>Consequently, none of the clock modelling examples that have been presented will work, since they all start at x and never change.</p>
