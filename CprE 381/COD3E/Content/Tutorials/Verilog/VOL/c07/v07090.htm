				We have already defined a race condition to be a situation where the behavior of the model depends on the order of execution of events at the same simulated time. (See <a href="javascript:parent.gotoScreen('03','105',1)">Defined vs. Undefined Behavior (Races) in Chapter 3.</a>)
				<p>In general, a race condition occurs when a data value is sampled in one process and changed in another at the same simulated time.</p>
				<p>A simple race is:</p>
				<p></p>
				<pre>
	initial				initial
	   #100 a = 1;			   #100 if(a) $display(&quot;a is 1&quot;);
</pre>
				The $display statement may or may not be executed, depending on the order of execution of the two events at time 100.
				<p>We will list a few common types of constructs which can cause races. This is by no means an exhaustive list.</p>
