			<td valign="top" width="390">It is more common for the different pipe stages to be in different processes, and often in different modules. The three stage pipe might look more like this:
				<p></p>
				<pre>
module pipeline (out, in, clock);
    output out;
    input  in, clock;
    reg    out, pipe1, pipe2;
    
    always @(posedge clock)
        out = pipe2;
        
    always @(posedge clock)
        pipe2 = pipe1;
        
    always @(posedge clock)
        pipe1 = in;
endmodule
</pre>
				This, however, doesn't work, and it is worth repeating that the source order of the different always blocks makes no difference. As we have pointed out before, both of the following alternatives will work.
				<p></p>
				<pre>
   always@(posedge clock)		always@(posedge clock)
      out 
					
					
					<= pipe2; out="#d" pipe2; always@(posedge clock) always@(posedge clock) pipe2 <= pipe1;			   pipe2 = #d pipe1;   always@(posedge clock)		always@(posedge clock)      pipe1 <= in;			   pipe1 = #d in;</PRE>Many designers use an intra-assignment delay with a non-blocking assign in this case. While it works, there is no benefit to doing it, and it is somewhat less efficient than either of these two methods. <td width="210" valign="top"><img src="images/v0132g1.gif" width="208" height="86"></TABLE></FONT></BODY></HTML>>>
