			<td width="600">Typically, the clock is used to change the state based on the inputs which have been seen up to that point. It is often convenient to think of all the activity of the state machine as taking place on the clock edge:
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>sample inputs
					<li>compute next state
					<li>compute outputs
					<li>change state
					<li>produce outputs
				</ul>
				<p>There are two common variations of state machines, Mealy and <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#mooremach')"><font color="#B22222">Moore machines</font></a>. <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#mealymach')"><font color="#B22222">Mealy machines</font></a> produce outputs based on both current state and input, while Moore machines produce outputs based only on the current state. As you would expect, the Verilog representation of the two types is very similar.</p>
