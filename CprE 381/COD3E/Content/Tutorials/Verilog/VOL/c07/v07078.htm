			<td valign="top" width="600">Because there are different times associated with each of the evaluations, there are separate events scheduled for each of the assignments. The different event lists would look like:

				<center>

				<p>In the zero-delay case, the three evaluations which get done as propagations from the r1 event may be done immediately, one after the other. Thus, the overhead of putting events on the event list and having the scheduler take them off is avoided. This can be substantial. It is possible for the difference in execution time to be as much 50%.</p>
