			<td valign="top" width="335">In general, Verilog simulators have two separate phases, compilation and simulation. The time taken to compile the model may be relatively short, in the case of an interpreter, or it may be relatively long, in the case of a compiler. However, even interpreters have a compile step.
				<p>Compile time is influenced by the requirement that the entire model be compiled at one time. It is possible to incrementally compile only those parts of the model which have changed, but it is necessary to read the entire source to determine which modules have changed - looking at a modification time is not sufficient.</p>
				<p>There is not a lot that you can do to influence compile time, with one major exception. That is, if you separate the stimulus from the model, the model needs to be compiled only once for a series of tests while the stimulus changes from test to test. If the stimulus is included in the Verilog source along with the model, then the whole thing must be compiled for each test. This is extremely inefficient, and should be avoided</p>
