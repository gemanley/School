				<p>There is no substitute for measuring the performance of a model and experimenting with alternatives. However, besides buying a faster simulator, there are a number of things which can be done to improve the execution time of a simulation model. Here are some techniques to improve efficiency that we will discuss on the following screens.</p>
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Compile Time vs. Run Time</A>
					<li>Reduce the Number of Events</A>
					<li>Use Higher Levels of Abstraction</A>
					<li>Don't Split Vectors</A>
					<li>Avoid Bi-Direct Primitives</A>
					<li>Minimize RHS Evaluations in Continuous Assigns</A>
					<li>Optimize Always @(event_expression) Blocks</A>
