				<td width="496">The $strobe system task is just like $display, except that it waits until the end of the time step before printing. This can be useful to be sure that the output comes after all value changes.
					<p>Example:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    always @(posedge clock)
        state1 = newstate1;
    
    always @(posedge clock)
        state2 = newstate2;
        
    always @(posedge clock)
        $strobe($stime,,state1,,state2);
</pre>
					<p>This code would print out the new values of <tt>state1</tt> and <tt>state2</tt> at each rising clock edge, after all other processing had been completed. If you simply used $display here, you could not be sure that the displayed values were the new ones.</p>
