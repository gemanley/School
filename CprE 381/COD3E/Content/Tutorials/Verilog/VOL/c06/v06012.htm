						<pre>
    module A;
        reg x;              // 1
        ...
        task B;
            reg x;          // 2
            begin
                ...
                begin: C
                    reg x;  // 3
                    ...
                end
            end
        endtask
        
        initial
            begin: D
                reg x;      // 4
                ...
            end
    endmodule
</pre>
						<p>there is a module, a task, and two named blocks. There are four distinct registers, each named x within its local scope.</p>

						<p>Identifier references are resolved by means of normal scope rules. So a reference that appears in block C will first get resolved by definitions found in C, then by those found in B, then by those found in A. A reference in C will not be resolved by an identifier declared in D.</p>
						<p>However, you can reference an identifier outside of the normal scope rules by using its hierarchical name. This is known as a cross-module reference.</p>
