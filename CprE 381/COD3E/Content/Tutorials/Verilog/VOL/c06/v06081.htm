					<p>$readmem has the form:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
        $readmemh(file_name, input_memory, first_index, last_index);

				<td width="323">The data values are read into the specified memory according to the indices given. If there are more data values in the file than memory locations specified, only the required number are read, and a subsequent readmem can be executed to continue reading from that point.
					<p>If there are fewer data values in the file than specified by the indices, then as many as available are read and a warning message is given. Remaining memory locations are left unchanged.</p>
					<p>If the second index is omitted, the memory will be filled from the first index to the end of the memory as specified by the right-hand index in the memory declaration. If both the indices are omitted, then the entire array will be filled, beginning at the left-hand index and proceding to the right-hand index in the memory declaration.</p>
