				<td width="460">Simulation terminates when <tt>$finish</tt> executes. It also terminates when there are no more events on the event list. This makes sense, since there is nothing more for it to do.
					<p>Simulation terminating because the event list is exhausted is nearly always an error. For this to be the case, the clock loop is not running. Since most models have a clock, this usually means the clock has gone to <tt>x</tt>, and probably everything else, too.</p>
