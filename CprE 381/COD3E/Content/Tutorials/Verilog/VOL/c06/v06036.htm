				<td width="600">The force quasi-continuous assign statement has the same syntax as assign, but uses the force keyword:
					<p></p>
					<pre> 
        force lhs = rhs;
</pre>
					<p>The primary difference between force and the assign QCA is that the lhs of a force can be either a register or a net. If it is a register, then force acts very much like assign, the only difference being that force has higher precedence than assign.</p>
					<p>If the lhs of the force is a net, then when the force is removed, the net reverts back to its &quot;normal&quot; value immediately, unlike a register, which will not change until the next procedural assignment.</p>
					<p>The lhs may be a bit-select or part-select of a net, but not of a register.</p>
					<p>The <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#relstate')"><font color="#B22222">release statement</font></a></font> is used to remove a force condition from a register or net:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
        release lhs;
