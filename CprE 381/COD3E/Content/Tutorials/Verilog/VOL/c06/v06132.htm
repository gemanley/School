					<p>1. full connection<br>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						source *&gt; destination</blockquote>
					<p>2. parallel connection<br>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						source =&gt; destination</blockquote>
					<p>The full connection operator connects each bit of the source to each bit of the destination. If there are 4 bits in the source and 3 bits in the destination, then the full connection operator creates 12 paths.</p>
					<p>The parallel connection operator connects bits in the source to corresponding bits in the destination. If there are 4 bits in the source and 4 bits in the destination, then it creates 4 paths. A parallel connection may only be used between source and destination of the same size.</p>
