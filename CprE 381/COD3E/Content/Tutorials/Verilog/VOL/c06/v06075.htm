				<td width="320">This system task is used for printing output whenever any of its arguments change. Like $strobe, when it does print, it does so after all other events in that time step have occurred.
					<p>$monitor takes the same arguments as $display (see the discussion of Output Formats earlier in this section).</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    $monitor (arg1, arg2, arg3);
</pre>
					<p>is equivalent to</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    always @(arg1 or arg2 or arg3)
        $strobe (arg1, arg2, arg3);
</pre>
					<p>There is a slight difference, in that $monitor only takes effect when the system task is executed. There is another difference in that the output line will be emitted at the time the $monitor is executed in order to provide a reference point for the argument values.</p>
					<p>Only one $monitor may be active at a time. If a second $monitor task is executed, then the second one replaces the previous one. This is an annoying restriction.</p>
