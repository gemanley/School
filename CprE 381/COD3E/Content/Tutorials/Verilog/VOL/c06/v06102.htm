					<p>Example:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
        $display (&quot;The current time is %d&quot;, $time);
        $display ($time,&quot; now the value of x is %h&quot;, x);

				<td width="349">The value returned is scaled by the timescale units in effect for that module. See the discussion of time scale later in this chapter.
					<p><tt>$stime</tt> (short time) is just like $time, except that it returns a 32-bit value of time. The low order 32 bits of the time are returned. If any high-order bits are non-zero, there is no warning or error message.</p>
