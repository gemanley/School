				<td width="396">This system task is used to suspend simulation and enter whatever interactive environment the simulator may provide. Note that it is not useful for other, non-simulation activities, like synthesis or timing analysis.
					<p>Because each simulator provides a somewhat different interactive environment, what happens after $stop is executed is implementation-dependent. However, when the <tt>$stop</tt> task is executed, the simulation suspends at that point. It is not necessarily the case that simulation is at the end of a time step. It is the case that simulation is resumable as if the suspension had not happened.</p>
					<p>Example:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    initial begin
        repeat (5)
    #1000   $stop;
        $finish;
    end
</pre>
					<p>This example would allow the user to inspect the state of the simulation every 1000 time units 5 times before the simulation terminated.</p>
