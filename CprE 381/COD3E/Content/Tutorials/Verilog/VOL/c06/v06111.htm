					<p>The way to do that in Verilog is by using the:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
        `timescale time_unit/time_precision
</pre>
					<p>compiler directive.</p>

		<table width="600">
			<tr>
				<td width="376">This compiler directive tells the compiler how to interpret delays that it sees in the source. By using different values with `timescale, different modules or parts of the model can use delays with different time scales, and the compiler can scale them all correctly.
					<p>For example, one module could specify its delays in microseconds and another module could specify its delays in nanoseconds, and the simulator could handle them consistently.</p>
