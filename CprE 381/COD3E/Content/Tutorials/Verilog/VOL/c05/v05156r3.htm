instead of 

 always @(negedge notReset)
            regOut = #resetToQ {size{1'b0}};

</pre>
					The reason for this is that if notReset was set to 0 in some other initial block, that might happen before the always had executed to begin waiting for the change on notReset. In that case, the reset event would be missed.</td>
