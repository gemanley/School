				<td>When the event expression consists of a net or register, any value change on that net or register satisfies the event. In the example above, <tt>@state</tt> would be satisfied whenever state changed value. This could happen for any number of reasons, most commonly continuous or procedural assignment, but including task parameter update and port assignment. Note that <tt>x-&gt;z</tt> and <tt>z-&gt;x</tt> are considered value changes, as are <tt>1-&gt;x, 0-&gt;x, x-&gt;1 and x-&gt;0.</tt>
					<p>In this way, simulation is somewhat different from real life, since the x in simulation is a 1 or 0 in real life. Consequently, the simulation may indicate a change event that the real circuit might not see.</p>
