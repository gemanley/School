				<td>The if-else-if construct is really not a special case, but it does occcur frequently. That is,
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    if (cond_1)
        statement1;
    else if (cond_2)
        statement2;
    else if (cond_3)
        statement3;
    else
        statement4;
</pre>
					This works as you would expect. If any of <tt>cond_1 .. cond_3</tt> are true, the first one encountered will cause its associated statement, and only its associated statement to be executed. If none of <tt>cond_1 .. cond_3</tt> are true, then <tt>statement4</tt> will be executed.</td>
