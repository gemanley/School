				<td>A more interesting problem is what happens if you make multiple assignments to the same register using non-blocking assignments? Consider the following:
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    for (i=0; i&lt;5; i=i+1)
        x &lt;= i;
</pre>
					This will cause <tt>x</tt> to successively be assigned the values <tt>0</tt> through <tt>4</tt>. However, since all the non-blocking events are executed together, you can't see the values <tt>0..3</tt>, only the final value of <tt>4</tt>.
					<p>Now consider this case:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    for (i=0; i&lt;5; i=i+1)
        x &lt;= #i i;
</pre>
					When this loop executes at time t, it will have scheduled 5 events to occur at time <tt>t, t+1, t+2, t+3</tt>, and <tt>t+4</tt>. Each will assign a different value to <tt>x</tt>. This is the only mechanism in Verilog to effect a transport delay.</td>
