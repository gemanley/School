				<td>The repeat loop is a very simple construct. The loop body is executed as many times as indicated by the count_expr. The count expression is evaluated once, before loop execution begins, so the loop count is not affected by changes to any of the variables used in the expression.
					<p>If the repeat count is negative or <tt>x</tt>, the loop is not executed. Unlike the other loop statements, all repeat loops must eventually terminate.</p>
					<p>Examples</p>
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>repeat (5) s1;
						<dd>repeat (f(x,y)) s2;
						<dd>repeat (loopcount) s3;
					</dl>
					</TT></td>
