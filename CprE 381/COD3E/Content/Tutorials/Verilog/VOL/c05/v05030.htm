				<td>The simplest event expressions consist of an event identifier. An event identifier is an identifier which was declared as an event, as in the declaration above of <tt>e1</tt>.
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>event e1;
					</dl>
					</TT><a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#declaredev')"><font color="#B22222">Declared events</font></a></font> have no value, they just are impulses. The only way a declared event can occur is for an event trigger statement to be executed:
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>-&gt;e1;
					</dl>
					</TT>When it occurs, any event control waiting on that event will be satisfied. Any new event control for that event which is subsequently executed will wait for the next execution of an event trigger for that event.
					<p>Declared events are rarely used.</p>
