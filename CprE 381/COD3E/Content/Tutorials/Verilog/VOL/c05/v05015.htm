				<td width="600">Simulation controls can be applied to any procedural statement, and they can also be used within procedural assignment statements. The general format is:
					<p></p>
					<pre>
[control] &lt;statement&gt;
						
						
						<p>
</p>
						
						
					</pre>
					If the control is present, then the condition that it specifies must be satisfied before the statement can be executed. If no control is present, then the statement can be executed immediately when the program counter gets to it. (Program counters are explained on the next screen.)
					<p>The statement to which the control is attached may be null. For example,</p>
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>control ;
							<p></p>
					</dl>
					</TT>is legal.
					<p>There are two types of simulation controls:</p>
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>#delay - time control
						<dd>@event - event control
					</dl>
					</TT></td>
