				<td>When a procedural assignment is made to a register, the new value must potentially be propagated to a number of places. Specifically, that register could appear on the right hand side of a continuous assignment, or it could appear in an event control in some other procedural statement.
					<p>For example,</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    reg [7:0] x, y;
    wire [8:0] out;
    assign out = x + y;
    
    always 
        @x y = y + 1;
    
    initial begin
        x = 0; y = 0;
        ...
    #2  x = 5;
        ...
    end
</pre>
					In the above, when x changes value, its new value must be propagated to both the continuous assignment and to the event control &quot;<tt>@x</tt>&quot;. This propagation must occur before simulation time can advance. However, it is not defined exactly when in relation to other events at the current time the propagation will take place.
					<p>Some simulators will propagate an assignment before the next procedural statement is executed, and some simulators will continue to execute procedural statements until encountering a statement which is blocked, at which time all left-hand sides of assignments will be propagated. Either method is logically correct.</p>
					<p>If we added the following statement to this example:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
    always 
        @y x = x + 1;
</pre>
					then there is a guaranteed order of execution at time 2:
					<pre>
        x = 5; -&gt; y = y + 1; -&gt; x = x + 1; -&gt; out = x + y;
</pre>
					The continuous assignment to out may execute before the last time as well, and could, in fact, execute as many as three times or as few as once.
					<p>Question:<br>
						In the above example, find the a race between the assignments of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, and the propagation of <tt>x</tt>. What are the two different possible outcomes if you display <tt>y</tt> at time 1?</p>
