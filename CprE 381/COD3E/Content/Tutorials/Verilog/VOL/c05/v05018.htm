				<td width="600">Procedural code has a notion of sequentiality. A procedural block is defined as:
					<p></p>
					<pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always &lt;statement&gt;<br>
						
						
						
or&nbsp;&nbsp;initial &lt;statement&gt;
						
						
						<p>
</p>
						
						
					</pre>
					where &lt;statement&gt; can be:<br>
					<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a single statement<br>
						
						
						
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sequential block (begin &lt;statement&gt; ... ; &lt;statement&gt; end)<br>
						
						
						
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a parallel block (fork &lt;statement&gt; ... ; &lt;statement&gt; join)
						
						
						<p>

</p>
						
						
					</pre>
					When a sequential block is executed, the statements are executed one after the other, beginning with the first one. Each sequential block has its own <b>program counter</b>, which indicates which statement is being executed. Note that simulation time may pass between sequential statements or during a single statement.
					<p>Unlike traditional sequential programming languages, there may be many program counters in a Verilog model. In fact, there is one for each process in the model. For example, two processes might have program counters (pc) in the following configurations:</p>
