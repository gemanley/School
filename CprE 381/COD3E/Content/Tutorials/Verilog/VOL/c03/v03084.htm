				<td>It is important to keep in mind that actions only actually happen at discrete time instants. When one of the above assignments takes place, time is stopped. It will move on after all assignments (or events in general) at that time have been accomplished. An event which in real life takes some amount of time to occur is idealized to occur only at a single instant. If the process of occuring is important to the model, then more than one event must be used to delineate it (usually a start and a stop event, though you could have mid-process events as well).
