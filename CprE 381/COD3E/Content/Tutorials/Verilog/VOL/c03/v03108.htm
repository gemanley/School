				<td valign="TOP" width="530">When simulation starts, all of the nets and registers in the model must have some initial value. Since all nets and registers have a minimum of 4 data values, and one of them is the unknown value x, it is natural for all initial values to be x.
					<p>There is a distinction between initialization time and time 0. Initialization time is when the time is 0 and no events have occurred. The first events will occur at time 0, at least one for each procedural block in the model. All nets and registers have their initial values before the first event executes.</p>
