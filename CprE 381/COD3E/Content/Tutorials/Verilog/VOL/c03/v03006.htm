				<td width="380">An expression is a combination of operands and operators which produces a single result. It is a function of its operands. An expression can be used anywhere that a value is needed in a statement.
					<p>Typical expressions are:</p>
					<p><tt>1+2<br>
							3'b100 &gt;&gt; shift_cnt<br>
							{control, data, check_bit}<br>
							bus[31:28] * state_val</tt></p>
					<p></TT>The result of an expression has a bit-length, just like any constant, net, or register. The rules governing the resulting length of an expression are fairly complicated, but generally they obey the principle of least surprise. That is, the result length is usually what you would expect.</p>
