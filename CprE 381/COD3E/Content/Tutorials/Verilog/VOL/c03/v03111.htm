				<td>While we normally think of a net as having a value, the value is derived from the values of whatever drivers there are on that net. For initialization, this actually makes a difference, since the drivers are the things which have x as their initial values, and the net resolution function works normally. So, at initialization, if a net has any drivers attached to it, the net will take on the value of the driver (<tt>x</tt>), unless there is a resolution function which overrides it.
