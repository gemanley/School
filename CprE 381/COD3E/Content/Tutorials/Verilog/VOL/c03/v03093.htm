				<td>A typical Verilog model contains many separate processes. These include procedural blocks -- always and initial blocks -- as well as continuous assigns and primitive instances. Each of these can be thought of as an independent process.
					<p>Processes are concurrent and asynchronous, but there are features in the language with which processes can be synchronized. These include time delays, event controls, and value propagation.</p>
