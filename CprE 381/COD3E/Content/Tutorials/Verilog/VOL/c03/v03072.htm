				<td>Some nets are not expected to take a z value, so it is not necessary to specify the turnoff delay. For these nets, you can simply use the rise and fall delays. If, by chance, the net does make a transition to z (or to x), the delay used will be the smaller of the two which are specified.
					<p>Similarly, most of the gate primitives cannot drive a z value, so it does not make sense to supply a turnoff delay for them. For these gates, the syntax specifies that you can only provide two delay values (the syntax description uses the term <tt>delay2</tt>, instead of <tt>delay3</tt>). The following gates take only two delay values:</p>
					<p><tt>and, nand, or, nor, xor, xnor, buf, not</tt></p>
