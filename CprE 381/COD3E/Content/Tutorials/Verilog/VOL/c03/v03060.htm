				<td>It is important to emphasize that simulation time is an abstract concept. It really is just a mapping of integers to events in a monotonically increasing order. That is to say, a delay value of &quot;10&quot; in Verilog is not 10 picoseconds, or 10 nanoseconds, or 10 seconds, or 10 years. It could be any of those, or none of them -- it all depends on an interpretation external to the model.
					<p>There is a way in Verilog to associate time units to the numbers which are used for delay values (see timescale in Chapter 6), but that is simply an interpretation placed on the abstract notion of simulation time. You may like to think of time delays in terms of familiar units, but to the simulator, time is just a set of integers, starting at 0.</p>
