				<td>Time always advances. Like in real life, it can't back up. Also as in real life, time is relative. Though there is an absolute time kept in the simulator, in a sense it is irrelevant to the model. What counts in the definition of a process is how long something takes to happen (a delay). Consequently, delays are always specified as relative values, to be interpreted as &quot;now + delay_value&quot;.</td>
