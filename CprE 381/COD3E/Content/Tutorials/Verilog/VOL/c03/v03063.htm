				<td>In Verilog, the simulation time is a 64-bit quantity. When the simulation time is interpreted as very small real time units, like femtoseconds, 64 bits is necessary to represent a reasonable amount of real time. With 64 bits, 18,447 seconds can be represented if the smallest unit is femtoseconds. If a 32 bit quantity was used for time, then only 4.3 microseconds could be represented.</td>
