				<td width="480">Hardware is parallel by nature. The Verilog Hardware Description Language captures that behavior, as it is a parallel language. The language allows models to be constructed of concurrent, asynchronous processes. These processes are parallel, in the sense that they execute at the same time, and have no inherent ordering which is defined by the language semantics.
					<p>However, an implementation of Verilog, and here we mean a simulator, does not necessarily reflect truly parallel operation. Simulation on a single processor computer, which is the norm, must emulate parallel behavior. At best, a uni-processor simulator can reproduce just one of many possible trajectories through the simulation space of the model.</p>
