				<td>Events can be identified explicitly in the source of a model. The most common use of events is to cause a process to wait for an event to occur before proceeding. An event is identified by the &quot;<tt>@</tt>&quot; character. For example,
					<p><tt></tt></p>
					<dl>
						<dd>initial begin
						<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
						<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@(posedge clk) x = f(y);
						<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
						<dd>end
					</dl>
					<p></TT>The <tt>@(posedge clk)</tt> is called an event control. When execution gets to that statement, it will wait until the clock makes a transition from 0 to 1 before the assignment statement will be executed.</p>
