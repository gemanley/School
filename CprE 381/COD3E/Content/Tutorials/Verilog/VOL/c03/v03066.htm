				<td width="450">Delays are specified in several ways in Verilog. Delays are introduced with the &quot;#&quot; character. A delay can be assigned to a net driver (either a gate, primitive, or continuous assignment), or it can be assigned to the net directly.
					<p>For example, the following are all legal delay specifications:</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
	assign #10 net1 = ra + rb;
	xor #3 xo1(a, b, c);
	wire #(4,2) control_line;
</pre>
					<p>A delay can also be specified in procedural statements, causing time to pass before the execution of the next statement.</p>
					<p></p>
					<pre>
	always
		begin
#period/2      clk = ~clk;
		end
</pre>
					In a procedural delay, the delay value may be an arbitrary expression. By contrast, a delay in a declarative statement must be able to be evaluated at compile time, which is another way of saying it must be a constant or constant-valued expression.</td>
