				<td width="310">Verilog is a hardware description language but it is also a simulation language. The behavior which is described using Verilog can be reproduced by a Verilog simulator. The principal difference between the behavior exhibited by the model under simulation and the real hardware that the model represents is the time that the model's operation takes is much different from the time the real hardware will take. This difference can be orders of magnitude.
					<p>A simulation model, which is what a Verilog hardware description is, is made up of a collection of simultaneous activities, or processes. These processes exhibit some behavior over time, possibly interacting with each other. (In formal modelling terminology, the processes each have a set of states which they transition between. The trail of states is called a state trajectory. The union of all the sets of states is called the state space. Any given simulation run produces a single state trajectory out of the multitude of possible ones.)</p>
