				<td valign="top" width="365">Time is kept as a relative value, and is global to the entire set of processes (the model). We usually call this simulation time. In Verilog, simulation time is a 64-bit unsigned integer (time is always positive), and it can be obtained by the $time system function. The amount of time which passes between different events in a process affects the interaction with other processes. The total of all the delays in a given path through a process will determine how long that process takes.
