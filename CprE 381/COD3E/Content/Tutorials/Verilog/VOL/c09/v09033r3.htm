			<pre> 
 reason_calltf
                user-defined task/function was called
 reason_checktf
                user-defined task/function was scanned during compilation
 reason_sizetf
                user-defined function was scanned during compilation
 reason_endofcompile
                compilation finished, simulation about to start
 reason_paramvc
                change of value of a user-defined system task/function argument

                change of value of a driver of a user-defined system task/function argument
 reason_synch
                end of a time step enabled by tf_synchronize()
 reason_rosynch
                end of a time step enabled by tf_rosynchronize()
 reason_reactivate
                event scheduled by tf_setdelay()
 reason_force
                execution of a quasi-continuous assign on any net or register
 reason_release
                release of a quasi-continuous assign on any net or register
 reason_disable
                execution of a disable statement
 reason_interactive

 reason_startofsave
                start of execution of $save
 reason_save
                completion of execution of $save
 reason_restart
                execution of $restart
 reason_reset
                start of execution of $reset
