			Linking with VCS is different, because in the normal course of its operation it must link the object produced by the compiler with the run-time library. In essence, you simply add the object for your new routines to this link command and it will include them appropriately.
			<p>Because the link is done automatically by the VCS command, all you need to do is include the object files with the Verilog source files in the VCS command.</p>
			<pre>
    VCS ex_hello.v ex_hello.o -P hello.tab -o hello
</pre>
			This would produce an object file (hello) which can be run.
