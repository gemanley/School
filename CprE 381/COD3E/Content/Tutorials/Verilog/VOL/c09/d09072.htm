				<td width="600">The point of this example is to show how a user routine can inspect the structure of a model. This routine (power) gets called with a module instance name as the argument, and it uses that to find out how many drivers and how many loads each net in the module has.
					<p>New utility routines used:</p>
					<p>acc_next_net ( module, net )<br>
						Returns a handle to the next net in the module instance. All the nets in the module are ordered (somewhat arbitrarily), so &quot;next&quot; means &quot;the one after this one&quot;, where &quot;this one&quot; is the one whose handle is the second parameter.</p>
					<p>acc_next_driver ( net, driver )<br>
						Returns a handle to the next driver for this net. Again, the drivers of each net are ordered.</p>
					<p>acc_next_load ( net, load )<br>
						Returns the next load on this net. This is the fan-out of the net.</p>
					<p>acc_fetch_fullname ( net )<br>
						Returns the full hierarchical name of the object.</p>
