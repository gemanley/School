			<td width="600">The utility routines which are provided allow you to obtain data from the model and let you modify data in the model. There are too many utility routines (more than 200 at last count) to describe them all here. We will describe some of the most common, and use some in examples. You should consult the Verilog-1364 LRM for complete descriptions.
				<p>In general, there are two classes of utility routines:</p>
				<p>1. <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#tfrout')"><font color="#B22222">TF routines</font></a><br>
					Routines whose names begin with &quot;tf_&quot;. These routines are used when the signal (net or register) to be read or written (register) has been identified in the system task or function's parameter list.</p>
				<p>2. <a href="javascript:parent.goGlossHash('#accroutines')"><font color="#B22222">ACC routines</font></a><br>
					Routines whose names begin with &quot;acc_&quot;. These routines can be used to access arbitrary data values within the model.</p>
				<p>There is history involved in the two sets of routines. The TF routines were the first implemented, and are more limited than the ACC routines. Consequently, they are simpler and more efficient. The ACC routines, on the other hand, can do many more things than the TF routines can.</p>
