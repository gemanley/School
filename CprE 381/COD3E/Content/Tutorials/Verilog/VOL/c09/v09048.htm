			<td width="600">The ACC routines are so-called because they are used to access arbitrary objects in the model. These were later additions to the PLI, and are considerably more powerful than the older TF routines.
				<p>In general, the ACC routines allow you to get and put the values of objects in the model identified by &quot;handles&quot;. These utility routines can manipulate any object in the model for which a handle can be obtained.</p>
				<p>Handles can be obtained from a variety of sources, like a hierarchical name. One of the more useful ways to obtain a handle is by means of the &quot;acc_next_&quot; functions. If you know one handle, you can find the &quot;next&quot; one in a list by means of these routines. For instance, if you know the handle of a port, you can get the handle of the &quot;next&quot; port. Giving a next routine a null handle as the current object will cause it to return the first object in its list.</p>
