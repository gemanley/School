		<h2><a id="Locating" name="Locating"></a>Locating Content</h2>
		<p>The navigation sidebar contains buttons to access the content of this CD according to category.</p>
		<p>The Search page provides a search engine for locating content containing keywords. Click on the Search sidebar button to go to the search page.</p>
		<p>Since the content of this CD is delivered primarily in Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format), you can search within individual documents using the search features of your PDF viewer. For more information on searching within a PDF file, see the help menu within your PDF viewer.</p>
		<p>The CD also includes an index for the content of the book and the CD Sections. Index entries refer to content by page number.</p>
		<h3><a id="Numbering" name="Numbering"></a>Page, Figure and Exercise Numbering</h3>
		<p>The material in the printed book and on this CD uses a numbering scheme designed to allow you identify where to locate the material.</p>
		<p>Pages in the book are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...). Pages in sections on the CD are numbered according to their section. For example, in CD Section 1.7, the pages are numbered 1.7-1, 1.7-2, and so on.</p>
		<p>So if you see a simple page number, you know to look for the page in the book. If you see a page number of the form <i>x.y-z</i>, you know to look in Section <i>x.y</i> on the CD for page <i>z</i>.</p>
		<p>Figures are also numbered differently in the book and on the CD. In the book, figures are numbered with the chapter number and a sequential figure number. For example, in Chapter 1, figures are numbered 1.1, 1.2, and so on. On the CD, figures are numbered with the section number and a sequential figure number within that section. For example, in CD Section 6.7, figures are numbered 6.7.1, 6.7.2, and so on.</p>
		<p>So if you see a figure number for the form <i>x.y</i>, you know to look in Chapter <i>x</i> in the book for the <i>y</i>'th figure. If you see a figure number of the form <i>x.y.z</i>, you know to look in Section <i>x.y</i> on the CD for the <i>z</i>'th figure.</p>
		<p>The exercises for each chapter are located in a numbered section of that chapter.  Each exercise is numbered with the chapter number and a sequential exercise number.  For example, in Chapter 2, exercises are numbered 2.1, 2.2, and so on.  In More Depth (IMD) and For More Practice (FMP) exercises are listed in the book, referring to the detailed descriptions on the CD.</p>
		<p>Pages of the IMD and FMP sections are numbered as for CD&nbsp;Sections, but prefixed with &quot;IMD&quot; and &quot;FMP&quot;, respectively. For example, in Chapter 2, exercises appear in Section 2.20. So IMD pages are numbered IMD 2.20-1, IMD 2.20-2, and so on. FMP pages are numbered FMP 2.20-1, FMP 2.20-2, and so on.</p>

		<h2><a id="Issues" name="Issues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
		<p>Issues reported as of 8 July 2004</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In some circumstances, clicking on a button in the navigation bar causes content to be displayed in a new browser window instead of in the main frame of the existing browser window. The CD developers have been unable to reproduce the behavior consistently, but are aware of its occurrence. The behavior has been observed under Internet Explorer 6 on Windows systems, and appears to occur after a link has been followed to an external website (for example, in the CD Library). To remedy the problem, exit and restart the browser.
