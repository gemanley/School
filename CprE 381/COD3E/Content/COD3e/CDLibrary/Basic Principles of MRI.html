					<h3>History of Magnetic Resonance</h3>
					<P>In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward 
        Purcell independently discovered that a magnetically energized substance 
        bombarded with RF emitted a "tune" similar to a tuning fork. They found 
        that the nuclei of different atoms absorbed radio waves at different 
        frequencies. In 1952, Bloch and Purcell received the Nobel Prize for 
        their discovery of what was referred to as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
        (NMR), eventually to be known as Magnetic Resonance (MRI). In 1970, the 
        medical imaging world significantly changed with the contributions of 
        Dr. Raymond Damidian. Dr. Damidian discovered that the structure and 
        abundance of water in the human body was the key to MR imaging, and that 
        the water (hydrogen) emitted a signal that was both detectable and 
        recordable. Dr. Damidian and his team spent the next seven years 
        diligently designing and creating the first MRI scanner for medical 
        imaging of the human body. It was Paul Lauterbur, however, who 
        implemented the concept of tri-plane gradients used for exciting 
        selective areas of the body (G<SUB>x, </SUB>G<SUB>y, and 
        </SUB>G<SUB>z.</SUB>). </P>
					<P>MR was earlier referred to and is 
        based on the physics of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). MRI is a 
        second generation term for this imaging modality. The term MRI was 
        adopted soon after imaging of the human body became possible as the 
        public could more easily adopt a term for an imaging modality without 
        the word "nuclear" in it. Thus we have magnetic resonance imaging 
        (MRI).</P>

						<h3>Magnets and Magnetism</h3>
						<P><STRONG>3 Types of 
        Magnets</STRONG></P>
						<P>There are three types of magnets used 
        commercially in medical imaging. All three provide homogenous large 
        magnetic fields. The main differences are the strengths, energy 
        requirements, production costs, and the magnetic field 
        direction.</P>
						<P><STRONG>Permanent 
        Magnets</STRONG></P>
						<P>Permanent magnets require very little 
        maintenance. Permanent magnets operate up to approximately 0.4 T. This 
        magnet does not require cryogens or a large power supply. The magnetic 
        field is measured vertically within the bore of the magnet. The main 
        disadvantages of a permanent magnet are the cost of the magnet itself 
        and supporting structures and the varying changes in the magnetic field. 
        Field homogeneity can be an on-going problem in permanent 
        magnets.</P>
						<P><STRONG>Resistive 
        Magnets</STRONG></P>
						<P>Resistive magnets are composed of coils 
        of wire with a magnetic field induced through it. They are similar to 
        superconductive magnets. The wires are not cooled down by cryogens, and 
        if the current was sent through the coils, but the power disconnected, 
        the current would decrease and eventually be non-existent. The resistive 
        magnet does not require cryogens, however, it needs a constant power 
        supply to maintain a homogenous magnetic field, and can be quite 
        expensive to maintain. Resistive magnets operate at fields no greater 
        that 0.4 T.</P>
						<P><STRONG>Superconductive 
        Magnets</STRONG></P>
						<P>Superconductive magnets are the most 
        common of all the magnets. The magnetic field is in the direction of the 
        long axis of the cylinder or bore of the magnet. Superconductive magnets 
        are composed of coils of wire carrying current. Since the resistance in 
        the coils can cause the current to decay, cryogens reduce the resistance 
        to almost zero, which will help maintain a homogenous magnetic field 
        over time. Superconductive magnets operate clinically up to 2 
        T.</P>
						<P><STRONG>Magnetic 
        Properties</STRONG></P>
						<P>Matter has varying magnetic properties. 
        A diamagnetic substance shows no magnetic properties when outside a 
        magnetic field. Once in the presence of a magnet field, a diamagnetic 
        substance is slightly repelled by the magnetic field. Like a diamagnetic 
        substance, paramagnetic substances also do not have magnetic properties 
        outside a magnetic field. However, once in the presence of a magnetic 
        field, a slight attraction occurs. Ferromagnetic substances are 
        extremely attracted to magnets, and can be dangerous in the clinical 
        setting. Caution should be taken when taking any metallic foreign object 
        into the MRI scan room.</P>
						<P><STRONG>The Atom</STRONG></P>
						<P>In order to understand MRI, it is 
        necessary to understand the properties of atoms.&nbsp; Atoms consist of a 
        dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.&nbsp; The nucleus of 
        most atoms is made up of positively charged particles called protons, 
        and neutrally charged particles called neutrons. The nucleus of an atom 
        is always positively charged due the positive protons. The electrons 
        orbiting around the nucleus are extremely small negatively charged 
        particles which balance the positive charge of the nucleus. Chemical 
        properties of elements vary based on the electrical charge of the atoms. 
        An atom with the same number of protons and electrons is chemically 
        neutral and stable. Often, electrons are added or knocked out of the 
        orbits around nuclei, which alters the charge of atom thus creating a 
        positively or negatively charged particle. An atom which is positively 
        or negatively charged is referred to as ionized.

      bgColor=#ffffff>The simple nucleus of the <B>hydrogen atom</B> consists 
        of one <B>proton, </B>and no <B>neutrons</B>. The hydrogen atom has a 
        positive charge and an atomic number of 1 due to the presence of only 
        one proton in its nucleus. For the purposes of MR, the hydrogen atom is 
        referred to as a <B>proton</B>. The abundance of the hydrogen atoms in 
        the human body, and the large <B>magnetic moment</B> (discussed below) 
        created by the single proton in the nucleus of the atom, make hydrogen 
        atoms extremely sensitive to magnetic resonance. Based on these facts, 
        we will concentrate on the <B>hydrogen atom</B> for the duration of this 
        section. Hydrogen has the simplest atomic structure compared to all 
        other elements. There is an abundance of hydrogen in the human body. 
        Approximately 70% of the body is made up of water which contains two 
        hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It is the hydrogen atoms that are 
        focused on to produce an MR image.
						<p><FONT size=4><B>Spin</B></FONT></p>
						<P>The moving (<B>spinning</B>) hydrogen protons create a <B>magnetic 
        field</B>, and thus perform as a tiny magnet with a north and a south 
        pole. Since there are two magnetic poles, the protons are referred to 
        <B>magnet dipoles</B>. Based on the laws of electromagnetism, any 
        electrically charged particle which moves creates a magnetic field 
        called a <B>magnetic moment</B>. This is the property that allows 
        hydrogen protons to behave predictably within an external magnetic 
        field. The motion or the "spin" of the hydrogen atoms can be described 
        as a random combination of the spinning of a top, the spin of a bowling 
        ball and the rotation of the earth around its axis. Understanding the 
        magnetic moment of the hydrogen protons, will lead to an understanding 
        of the <B>alignment</B> of the protons within a 
  magnet.</P>

						<P>Hydrogen nuclei magnetic moments are randomly oriented in the absence 
        of an external magnetic field and are considered to have a <B>net 
        magnetization</B> of zero. Once hydrogen protons are placed in the 
        presence of an external magnetic field, they align themselves in one of 
        two directions, <B>parallel</B> or <B>anti-parallel</B> to the net 
        magnetic field which is commonly referred to as the vector 
        <B>B<SUB>0</SUB></B>. The strength of the external magnetic field and the thermal energy of the atoms are the factors which affect the direction of alignment of the hydrogen protons. The high energy protons are strong enough to align themselves against or anti-parallel to the magnetic field, whereas the lower energy protons will align themselves with or parallel to the magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, there are fewer protons which are strong enough to align anti-parallel to the magnetic field. There are always a larger number of protons aligned parallel with the magnetic field (B<SUB>0</SUB>), so once the 
        parallel and anti-parallel protons cancel each other out, only the small 
        number of low energy protons left aligned with the magnetic field create 
        the overall net magnetization of the patient’s body. Even though there 
        are relatively only a few protons creating the net magnetization of the 
        patient’s body, this <B>difference</B> is all that counts. The magnetic 
        moments of these protons are added together and are referred to as

      bgColor=#ffffff><font size="4"><b>The Larmor Frequency</b></font>
						<P>Tesla (T) or <B>gauss</B> is the 
        measure of strength of the magnetic field. One Tesla is equivalent to 
        10,000 gauss, and is about 20,000 times stronger than the earth’s 
        magnetic field. All protons precess at the same frequency within a 
        magnetic field. The <B>gyro-magnetic ratio</B> of hydrogen is 42.57 
        MHz/Tesla. The gyro-magnetic ratio is different for each nucleus of 
        different atoms. The frequency is determined by the gyro-magnetic ratio 
        of atoms and the strength of the magnetic field. The <B>Larmor 
        </B>equation is important because it is the frequency at which the 
        nucleus will absorb energy. The absorption of that energy will cause the 
        proton to alter its alignment. In MR imaging, the energy that is 
        transferred is radio frequency waves (RF) and ranges from 1-100 MHz. The 
        Larmor equation governs the value of the precessional frequency, and is 
        follows:</P>
						<P><b>Precessional frequency 
        (w <SUB>O</SUB>) = B<SUB>0</SUB> x l <br>
									   </b>B<SUB>0 </SUB>= the magnetic 
        field strength of the magnet <br>
								   <B>l </B>= the gyro-magnetic ratio.<br>
						</P>
						<p>At 1 T the precessional frequency 
        of hydrogen is 42.57 MHz (1 T x 42.57 MHz)</p>
						<p>At 1.5 T the precessional 
        frequency of hydrogen is 42.57 MHz (1.5 T x 63.86 MHz)</p>
						<P>The stronger the magnetic field, 
        the higher the <B>precessional frequency</B>. If an RF pulse at the 
        Larmor frequency is applied to the nucleus of an atom, the protons will 
        alter their alignment from the direction of the main magnetic field to 
        the direction opposite the main magnetic field. As the proton tries to 
        realign with the main magnetic field, it will emit energy at the 
        frequency of the Larmor frequency.</P>
						<b>Resonance</b> is referred to as the property of an atom to absorb energy only at the Larmor frequency. This is the basis of MR. An atom will only absorb external energy if that energy is delivered at precisely it’s resonant frequency. The energy must also be delivered at 90° to the net magnetic vector (NMV) and main magnetic field (B<SUB>0</SUB>). Otherwise, no energy will be 
        absorbed, resonance will not have occurred and an image cannot be 
        created. <B>Excitation</B> occurs when the proton absorbs the applied 
        energy or resonates. As resonance occurs and the NMV moves out of 
        alignment with the B<SUB>0</SUB> to a pre-specified angle. The 
        deflection of the magnetization or total angle created after the end of 
        the RF pulse is referred to as the <B>flip angle</b>.
						<P><strong>Longitudinal and Transverse 
        Magnetization</strong></P>
						<P>The stronger the RF energy 
        applied to the protons, the greater the angle of deflection for the 
        magnetization. The two most common flip angles in MR are <B>90° </B>and 
        <B>180° </B>. A 90° pulse will flip the magnetization into the <B>x-y 
        plane (Mxy)</B>. A 180° pulse will flip the magnetization through the 
        x-y plane and into the opposite direction of B<SUB>0</SUB>.</P>

      bgColor=#ffffff>When a 90° pulse is 
        applied and the protons are given enough energy to be flipped into the 
        x-y plane, the net magnetization vector is now in the transverse plane. 
        B<SUB>0</SUB> or <B>z-axis</B> is now referred to as the longitudinal 
        plane. The protons are now rotating in the transverse plane at the 
        Larmor frequency. As well as flipping into the transverse plane, the 
        protons also begin rotating in phase with each other. When resonance 
        occurs, all the magnetic moments move into the same path or all flip the 
        same number of degrees, and they all precess in phase with other.
						<P>With the net magnetization in the 
        transverse plane (created with a 90° flip angle), and a receiver coil or 
        antenna in the transverse plane, a voltage is induced within the 
        receiver coil. This oscillating signal voltage over time is the MR 
        signal. The magnitude of the signal is dependent on the magnetization 
        present in the transverse plane. At the termination of the RF, the 
        freely precessing protons in the transverse plane <B>(Mxy)</B> give up 
        energy (RF) in order to try to realign with B<SUB>0</SUB>. As the 
        transverse magnetization starts to <B>decay </B>due to the loss of phase 
        coherence, the protons eventually realign with B<SUB>0</SUB>. This 
        <B>signal</B> produced by the decay of transverse magnetization is 
        called <B>free induction decay (FID).</B> The amplitude of the FID 
        signal becomes smaller over time as net magnetization returns to 
        equilibrium. Simultaneously, the longitudinal magnetization begins to 
        recover and return to B<SUB>0 </SUB>to a state of equilibrium just as if 
        nothing had occurred.</P>
						<P>After the external RF signal is 
        turned off, two phenomenons simultaneously occur. 
								
						<UL>
							<LI>Longitudinal magnetization 
          gradually increases and is called <B>T1 recovery </B>
							<LI>Transverse magnetization 
          gradually decreases and is called <B>T2 decay</B></LI>
						</UL>
						<P>These phenomena are discussed in 
        more detail below. In summary, atoms rotate randomly outside the 
        presence of a magnetic field. When in the presence of an external 
        magnetic field, the atoms align either with or opposed to the main 
        magnetic field. The parallel and anti-parallel protons cancel each other 
        out, leaving a relatively small number of protons aligned with the main 
        magnetic field. As an RF signal is applied at the Larmor frequency, the 
        individual protons resonate, or absorb the applied energy, and precess 
        in phase. Depending on the strength of the applied energy, the protons 
        will flip into the x-y plane (transverse magnetization), or exactly the 
        opposite direction of the main magnetic field. The transverse 
        magnetization induces a voltage in an antenna or receiver coil which 
        will be eventually become the MR signal. As the RF is turned off, the 
        protons dephase and lose their coherence as they try to realign with 
        B<SUB>0. </SUB>Two phenomenons occur simultaneously. Transverse 
        magnetization decreases (T2 decay), while longitudinal magnetization 
        increases (T1 recovery).</P>
						<P><FONT size=4><B>Longitudinal and Transverse Relaxation</B></FONT></P>
						<P><STRONG>Relaxation</STRONG> is a 
        very important process in MR imaging as it determines the type of signal 
        obtained greatly impacting the type of image generated. When the RF 
        pulse is terminated, the net magnetic vector (NMV) is once again 
        influenced by the main magnetic field (B<SUB>0</SUB>) and tries to 
        re-align with it along the longitudinal axis. Protons attempt to return 
        from a state of non-equilibrium to a state of equilibrium. As the NMV 
        gives up its absorbed RF energy while trying to return to B<SUB>0</SUB>, 
        the process of relaxation occurs. As relaxation is occurring, 
        magnetization is recovering in the longitudinal plane while decaying in 
        the transverse plane. Longitudinal and transverse magnetization occur at 
        simultaneously but are two completely different processes. To examine 
        the relaxation phenomena further, the net magnetization vector needs to 
        be divided into its two processes; longitudinal and transverse 
        magnetization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      bgColor=#ffffff><STRONG>Longitudinal 
        Relaxation</STRONG>
						<P><STRONG>Longitudinal 
        relaxation</STRONG> is the return of longitudinal magnetization to 
        equilibrium (B<SUB>0</SUB>) and is termed T1 recovery. As the hydrogen 
        atoms release their energy they previously absorbed to the surrounding 
        tissue (lattice), in their attempt to realign with the main magnetic 
        field, T1 relaxation or T1 recovery occurs. This phenomena is sometimes 
        referred to as "<STRONG>spin-lattice</STRONG>" relaxation and it occurs 
        exponentially over time. That rate of recovery is a time constant and is 
        referred to as T1. T1 recovery is the time it takes for 
        <STRONG>63%</STRONG> of the longitudinal magnetization to 
        "<STRONG>regrow</STRONG>" or <STRONG>recover</STRONG> in the 
        tissue.</P>
						<p><strong>Transverse Relaxation</strong></p>
						<P>As longitudinal magnetization is 
        occurring, it is accompanied by transverse relaxation. 
        <STRONG>Transverse relaxation</STRONG> is the return of transverse 
        magnetization to equilibrium. Although these two processes occur at the 
        same time, they are quite different and thus contribute significantly 
        different information to the resulting MR image. Unlike longitudinal 
        relaxation, transverse relaxation is not a process of dissipation or 
        absorption of energy into tissue. The <STRONG>decay of transverse 
        magnetization</STRONG> is a process called T2 decay. As the amount of 
        magnetization in the x-y (transverse) plane decreases, T2 decay 
        increases. After an RF pulse, hydrogen nuclei are spinning in unison or 
        in-phase with each other. As the magnetic fields of all the nuclei 
        interact with each other, energy is exchanged between those nuclei. The 
        nuclei which began spinning "in-phase", lose their phase coherence or 
        dephase over time and spin in a random fashion. This process results in 
        an exponential decrease or decay in transverse magnetization. Because T2 
        decay is the result of the exchange of energy between spinning hydrogen 
        nuclei, it is referred to as "<STRONG>spin-spin</STRONG>" relaxation. As 
        T2 decay occurs, the MR signal dies out. The rate of T2 decay is also 
        expressed as a time constant. T2 decay occurs when the transverse 
        magnetization has decreased to <STRONG>37%</STRONG> of its initial 
        value.</P>

      bgColor=#ffffff>Longitudinal 
        relaxation is a regrowth or an increase in value, whereas transverse 
        relaxation is a decrease or decay. Although these two processes occur 
        together, T2 decay almost always occurs more rapidly than the regrowth 
        of longitudinal magnetization.
						<P><B>Tissue Contrast</B></P>
						<P>Due to the T1 and T2 relaxation 
        properties, we can differentiate between various tissues in the 
        body.&nbsp; As well as T1 and T2 contrast in tissues, proton density can 
        also be measured. <STRONG>Proton density</STRONG> is measured by the 
        <STRONG>number of protons per unit of tissue</STRONG>. Various tissues 
        have different T1 and T2 values. These T1 and T2 values significantly 
        influence the type of signal generated during MRI and thus contribute 
        greatly to the MR image. <STRONG>Tissue contrast</STRONG> is affected by 
        not only the T1 and T2 values of specific tissues, but the differences 
        in the magnetic field strength, temperature changes and many other 
        factors. It is not imperative that one memorize the absolute T1 and T2 
        values in different tissues, but being aware of the values may make a 
        difference when the technologist is programming values for pulse 
        sequences. </P>
						<P><STRONG>Fat Versus 
        Water</STRONG></P>
						<P>Due to the slow molecular motion 
        of fat nuclei, longitudinal relaxation occurs rather rapidly and 
        longitudinal magnetization is regained quickly. The net magnetic vector 
        realigns with B<SUB>0</SUB> leading to a short T1 time for fat.&nbsp; 
        Water is not as efficient as fat in T1 recovery due to the high mobility 
        of the water molecules. Water nuclei do not give up their energy to the 
        lattice (surrounding tissue) as quickly as fat, and therefore take 
        longer to regain longitudinal magnetization resulting in a long T1 
        time.</P>
						<P>As we know, T2 decay is dependent 
        on the interaction of nuclei and the exchanging of energy with near by 
        nuclei. Fat has a very efficient energy exchange and therefore has a 
        relatively short T2. Water is less efficient than fat in the exchange of 
        energy, and therefore has a long 
  T2.</P>

						<P><STRONG>T1, T2 and Proton Density 
        Contrast</STRONG></P>
						<P>Fat has a shorter T1 time than 
        water, therefore the fat vector will realign more quickly with the main 
        magnetic field. It is obvious then that fat has a larger longitudinal 
        component than water. After a 90° pulse, the longitudinal magnetization 
        of both fat and water are flipped into the transverse plane. As 
        previously mentioned, fat has a larger longitudinal component prior to 
        an RF pulse, and it has a larger transverse component after an RF pulse. 
        Due to the larger longitudinal and transverse magnetization, fat has a 
        higher signal and will appear bright on a T1 contrast MR image. 
        Conversely, water has less longitudinal magnetization prior to an RF 
        pulse, therefore less transverse magnetization after an RF pulse 
        yielding low signal appearing dark on a T1 contrast image. Images 
        created with TR's and TE's to enhance T1 contrast are referred to as 
        T1-weighted images.</P>
						<P>The previously learned concepts 
        of transverse magnetization apply for T2 contrast. Fat has a shorter T2 
        time than water and relaxes or decays more readily than water. Since the 
        amount of transverse magnetization in fat is small, fat generates very 
        little signal on a T2 contrast image and appears dark. Water has a very 
        high T2 constant, therefore has very high T2 signal and thus appears 
        bright on a T2 contrast image. Images created with TR's and TE's to 
        enhance T2 contrast are referred to as T2-weighted images.</P>
						<P>Proton density contrast is a 
        quantitative summary of the number of protons per unit tissue. The 
        higher the number of protons in a given unit of tissue, the greater the 
        transverse component of magnetization, and the brighter the signal on 
        the proton density contrast image. Conversely the lower the number of 
        protons in a given unit of tissue, the less the transverse magnetization 
        and the darker the signal on the proton density 
    image.</P>

        Imaging: </STRONG>Emphasis is made on the differences on longitudinal 
        relaxation rates by utilizing a short TR and short TE. The short TR 
        allows full recovery of tissues with a short T1 (fat) to recover quickly 
        while allowing only partial recovery of tissues with a long TR (CSF). 
        The short TE used to obtain a T1-weighted image will allow minimal loss 
        of transverse magnetization due to T2 relaxation. Basically, short TR 
        increases T1 effects with the short TE minimizes T2 effects of 
        tissue.
						<P><STRONG>T2-Weighted Imaging: 
        </STRONG>Emphasis is made on the differences on transverse relaxation 
        rates by utilizing a long TR and long TE. The long TR allows tissues to 
        reach complete longitudinal magnetization which will reduce T1 effects. 
        The long TE will allow for the loss of transverse signal enhancing T2 
        effects. Fluid has a very long T2 and is frequently associated with 
        pathology, so it is important to take advantage of the imaging 
        parameters to accentuate signal differences. </P>
						<P>There are many parameters which 
        significantly contribute to the contrast of an image. Most of these 
        parameters are controlled or at least influenced by the technologist 
        creating the images. Care must be taken to create the best possible MR 
        images which will ensure a more accurate diagnosis by the 
        radiologist.&nbsp; Parameters contributing to an MR image should be 
        manipulated only by an experienced MR technologist who is aware of all 
        the factors which are changing during the 
    manipulation.</P>
