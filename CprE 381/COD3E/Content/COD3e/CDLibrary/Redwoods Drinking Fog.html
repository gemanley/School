						<p>When researcher Todd Dawson was young and living in Santa Cruz, California, he noticed that the coastal fog left a lot of moisture on the nearby redwoods. However, it wasn't until years later that he realized the fog saturating the trees' leaves might actually allow them to grow so tall. </p>
						<p>&quot;If redwoods are able to get water in two ways--through the soil via their roots and from fog--this will improve their overall water status and may contribute to their massive size,&quot; says Dawson, an associate professor of physiological plant ecology at the University of California&shy;Berkeley.</p>
						<p>Along with colleagues from Northern Arizona University, Humboldt State University, and Southern Oregon University, Dawson is engaged in a multifaceted set of research projects focusing on redwoods and the coastal ecosystems they inhabit. A primary component of his research, says Dawson, is understanding the relationship between redwoods and the fog that surrounds them.</p>
						<p>Through isotope analysis and by setting up water-collecting devices, Dawson and his colleagues have been able to both identify the source and amount of the water that redwood trees absorb.</p>
						<p>To date, the researchers have confirmed previously published findings that 25 to 40 percent of the water in coastal redwood forests comes from fog. What the researchers discovered that hadn't already been documented, however, was the way redwoods take that moisture in.</p>
						<p>The trees get some of that water through their roots, when fog-saturated leaves and branches drip water onto the ground. Exactly how redwoods get the rest is the focus of Dawson's ongoing research. He thinks the trees may actually be drinking water directly from fog through a symbiotic relationship with fungus living on their leaves.</p>
						<p>&quot;We noticed fungus penetrating the leaves of redwoods,&quot; says Dawson. &quot;This may be the route in which water from fog gets through the surface of the leaves.&quot;</p>
						<p>Dawson readily admits that neither he nor anyone else has demonstrated that this is indeed how trees are absorbing water through their leaves, but the presence of the fungus leads him to believe that it's acting in a manner similar to that of the microrhyzal fungi found on the roots of other plants.</p>
						<p>Yet, as astounding as this may be, for Dawson, the ability of redwoods to take in water directly from fog is only one small part of the fog&shy;coastal forest relationship. The bigger picture, he says, is understanding the role of the fog in the entire coastal ecosystem.</p>
						<p>Thus, Dawson and his colleagues are busy investigating fog's effects on the hydrology and productivity of coastal forests. </p>
						<p>&quot;In areas where redwoods have been cut down, the hydrology of the forest is different,&quot; says Dawson. &quot;The sites are drier, especially in the summertime, and this has an effect on the way water moves through theses forest ecosystems.&quot;</p>
						<p>Some of those effects take the form of greater runoff in areas where trees have been removed and a decrease in stream flow. </p>
						<p>However, Dawson says there's more to the fog&shy;coastal forest relationship than water.</p>
						<p>&quot;What's coming off the ocean is not just water. Fog also contains a significant amount of marine-derived nitrogen,&quot; Dawson says. </p>
						<p>Dawson and others are trying to understand the importance of this nitrogen source for coastal forest communities and whether it or water plays a more important role. Early results from the scientists' research in this area have indicated that areas near the coast are more productive than those further inland.</p>
