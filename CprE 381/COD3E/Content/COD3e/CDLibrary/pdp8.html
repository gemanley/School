	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The PDP-8 was the first mass-produced minicomputer. It was a 12-bit, word-addressed, accumulator-based design, first shipped in 1965. It was influenced by the CDC 160, the MIT Lincoln Labs LINC, and the DEC PDP-5.</p>
	<p>Instructions are one 12-bit word each.</p>
	<pre><font size="-1">        +-----+-+-+-------------+

           opc     3-bit opcode
           i       1-bit direct/indirect addressing mode
           p       1-bit global/current page for high address bits
           offset  7-bit offset

           effective address = p ? ( top 5 bits of last pc # offset )
                                 : ( 00000 # offset );
    </font></pre>
	A notable feature of the PDP-8 was the lack of a load instruction. Instead, you would first clear the accumulator (cla) and then add the contents of a memory loaction to the accumulator (tad). The function of a store was done by the deposit and clear accumulator (dca) instruction. The PDP-8 did provide a fast loop-closing instruction, increment and skip if zero (isz), that did not use the accumulator. The isz instruction was also used as a general way to increment memory locations apart from its function in loops.
	<h3>Interrupts</h3>
	<p>A single interrupt enable bit controlled whether or not interrupts would be accepted. Upon an interrupt,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the enable flag would be reset to 0 (disabled),
		<li>the updated PC would be saved into memory at address 0, and
		<li>the PC would be reset to address 1.
