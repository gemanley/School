		<b>The Black and White Portal</b>
		<p>This massive gate structure originally gave access to long-since destroyed staircases leading to the top of the Castillo. Although the colors of the stones have faded, it is constructed of black limestone on the right side, and white granite on the left. It has been accurately reassembled from the original stones which were found excavating this area.</p>
