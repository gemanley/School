		<b>On top of the New Temple Castillo</b>
		<p>The entranceway in the foreground gives access to the Double Mensula Gallery. Immediately above and to the left of this entrance is one of a pair of matching temple-top structures made of massive, well-cut stones. These may have been the foci of important ritual at Chav&iacute;n.</p>
