		<b>At the top of the Black and White Staircase</b>
		<p>The Black and White staircase was originally topped with an elaborate structure, probably much like the Black and White portal. Many of the large stones of this substantial structure are scattered in this area, and two broken massive columns, one of granite that was intentionally defaced and one of limestone, are among the many stones.</p>
