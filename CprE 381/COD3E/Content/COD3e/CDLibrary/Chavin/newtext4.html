		<b>At the Black and White Staircase</b>
		<p>Extensively dismantled in post-Chav&iacute;n times, this staircase is a spectacular example of Chav&iacute;n engineering and symbolism. The right half of the stairs are made of limestone, which is velvety black when freshly cut. The left half is white granite; this color dualism is clearly intention, and undoubtedly part of Chav&iacute;n beliefs. Lying on the steps are several examples of stones carved with Chav&iacute;n designs.</p>

			<li>Symbol over open-air hut:</b><br>Called &quot;The Altar of Choque Chinchay,&quot; this 10-ton limestone slab contains seven small circular pits that have been argued to form the pattern of the astronomical cluster called the Pleiades. The &quot;altar&quot; might suggest that this star cluster, which is used in modern times for monitoring agricultural planting and harvesting in the Andes, played a significant role in Chav&iacute;n times.
