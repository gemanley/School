		<b>The Lanz&oacute;n seen from a side chamber</b>
		<p>The Lanz&oacute;n is a 41/2 meter high granite stone, carved with the face and body of a Chav&iacute;n personage, perhaps one of the major deities of the cult practiced here. Its fanged smile, snake hair, and clawed hands and feet are typical of the Chav&iacute;n style.</p>
