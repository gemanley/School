					</table>Teams of Stanford students led by John Rick have conducted fieldwork at Chav&iacute;n in the summers of 1995 and 1996. The primary goal of the project is to accurately map the site using theodolite surveying technology; in these two seasons, the teams collected over 25,000 measured points, documenting the site topography, exterior architecture, and exterior sculptures. A number of sub-projects augment the greater mapping project. These include mapping the internal labyrinthine passageways known as the galleries, video-taping detailed interviews with the elderly and extremely knowledgeable site caretaker, and creating the virtual reality panoramas seen on this web-site. Individual students have conducted their own research at the site, resulting in undergraduate honors theses on significant topics such as site construction labor and the feline-human sculptures known as tenon heads. Fieldwork at Chav&iacute;n will continue in the summer of 1998.
					<p>The final product of the project will integrate all aspects of this research. A three-dimensional computer model based on exterior and interior architectural data will link with the virtual reality panoramas and video documentation for each area of the site. Together they will form a &quot;virtual fieldsite&quot; or &quot;hypothesis tester,&quot; with which people can walk through a virtual Chav&iacute;n, making observations, forming hypotheses about the construction of the site, its astronomical alignments, and yet-unknown aspects of the site, and then test them with the precise measuring capabilities of the site model.The model will be widely available on CD-ROM to archaeologists and the wider public.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, a CD-ROM of panoramic images of Chavin (including quite a number not included on this web site) and other Andean sites is available. Contact John Rick by email at <a href="mailto:johnrick@stanford.edu">johnrick@stanford.edu</a><br>
