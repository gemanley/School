		<b>Approaching the Upper Plaza of the New Temple</b>
		<p>Looking toward the massive Castillo structure, a complex of walls is visible. The long straight wall in the foreground is a late feature which cut through the Upper Plaza of the New Temple, and along the very bottom edge are small, rustic adobe structures excavated recently. Although argued to be quite early in date, they may be intrusive from a later period.</p>
		<p><b>In the Upper Plaza of the New Temple</b></p>
		<p>Although only the western half remains, this was originally a square plaza of reduced dimension, but with construction nearly identical to the Square Plaza to the east and below. The best preserved section is of black limestone; it seems likely that the the matching section to the south was of white granite, preserving the color duality which characterizes the central, ceremonial approach to the Castillo.</p>
