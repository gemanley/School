		<b>Inside the entrance to Lanzon Gallery</b>
		<p>The modern iron gate shows the way to the outside; opposite is the first passageway leading further into the gallery. Note the ventilation shaft to the right. In the alcove to the left of the passage a number of Chav&iacute;n carved stone items are in protective storage. The head, one of many tenon heads that originally were attached to the temple's exterior, shows abundant flow of mucus-like liquid from the nose.</p>
		<p><b>Still</b></p>
		<p>This is the one tenon head still in place on the outer wall of the Castillo near its southwest corner.</p>
