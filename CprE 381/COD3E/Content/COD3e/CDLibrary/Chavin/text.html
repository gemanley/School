		<b>In the center of the circular plaza.</b>
		<p>The large, well-preserved stairway leads up the back mound of the U-Shaped Old Temple, and opposite is a partially-preserved staircase leading to the site's lower terraces. Directly above this small staircase is a pointed hill; a observer standing in the center of the circular plaza will see the sun rise over this hill on December 21, the winter solstice of the Southern Hemisphere. The thatched roofing protects a series of engraved stone plaques portraying jaguars and Chav&iacute;n personages, revealed during excavations in the Circular Plaza.</p>
