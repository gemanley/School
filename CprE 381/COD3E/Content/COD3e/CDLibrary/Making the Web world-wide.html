"The creation of the <FONT size=-1>PC</FONT> is the best thing that ever happened,” said Bill Gates 
at a conference on “digital dividends” in 2000. He even wondered if it might be 
possible to make computers for the poor in countries without an electric power 
grid. The answer is yes, and things are going even further. Villagers in a 
remote region of Laos that has neither electricity nor telephone connections are 
being wired up to the Internet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Lee Thorn, the head of 
the Jhai Foundation, an American-Lao organization, has been working for nearly 
five years in the Hin Heup district. The foundation has helped villagers build 
schools, install wells and organise a weaving co-operative. But those villagers 
told Mr Thorn that what they needed most was access to the Internet. To have any 
hope of meeting that need, in an environment which is both physically harsh and 
far removed from technical support, Mr Thorn realised that a robust computer was 
the first requirement.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>He therefore turned to 
engineers working with the Jhai Foundation, who devised a machine that has no 
moving, and few delicate, parts. Instead of a hard disk, the Jhai <FONT 
size=-1>PC</FONT> relies on flash-memory chips to store its data. Its screen is 
a liquid-crystal display, rather than an energy-guzzling glass cathode-ray 
tube—an exception to the rule that the components used are old-fashioned, and 
therefore cheap. (No Pentiums, for example, just a 486-type processor.) Mr Thorn 
estimates that, built in quantity, each Jhai <FONT size=-1>PC</FONT> would cost 
around $400. Furthermore, because of its simplicity, a Jhai <FONT 
size=-1>PC</FONT> can be powered by a car battery charged with bicycle 
cranks—thus removing the need for a connection to the grid. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Wireless Internet cards 
connect each Jhai <FONT size=-1>PC</FONT> to a solar-powered hilltop relay 
station which then passes the signals on to a computer in town that is connected 
to both the Lao phone system (for local calls) and to the Internet. Meanwhile, 
the Linux-based software that will run the computers is in the final stages of 
being “localised” into Lao by a group of expatriates in America. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>One thing that the new 
network will allow villagers to do is decide whether it is worth going to 
market. Phon Hong, the local market town, is 30km away, so it is worth knowing 
the price of rice before you set off to sell some there. Links farther afield 
may allow decisions about growing crops for foreign markets to be taken more 
sensibly—and help with bargaining when these are sold. And there is also the 
pleasure of using Internet telephony to talk to relatives who have gone to the 
capital, Vientiane, or even abroad.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>If it works, the Jhai 
<FONT size=-1>PC</FONT> and its associated network could be a widespread 
success. So far, the foundation has had expressions of interest from groups 
working in Peru, Chile and South Africa. The prototype should be operational in 
Laos this December and it, or something very much like it, may soon be bridging 
the digital divide elsewhere as well.</FONT></P>
