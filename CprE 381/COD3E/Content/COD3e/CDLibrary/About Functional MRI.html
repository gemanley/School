      <P><U><STRONG><font color="black">INTRODUCTION</font><BR>
										</STRONG></U>The recent discovery that magnetic 
      resonance imaging can be used to map changes in brain hemodynamics that 
      correspond to mental operations extends traditional anatomical imaging to 
      include maps of human brain function. The ability to observe both the 
      structures and also which structures participate in specific functions is 
      due to a new technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, 
      and provides high resolution, noninvasive reports of neural activity 
      detected by a blood oxygen level dependent signal (Ogawa, et al, 1990 a 
      and b, 1992, 1993; Belliveau, et al, 1990, 1991). This new ability to 
      directly observe brain function opens an array of new opportunities to 
      advance our understanding of brain organization, as well as a potential 
      new standard for assessing neurological status and neurosurgical risk. The 
      following briefly introduces the fundamental principles of fMRI, current 
      applications at Columbia, and some potential future directions.</P>
      <P><U><STRONG><font color="black">WHAT IS fMRI? 
      </font><BR>
										</STRONG></U>Functional MRI is based on the increase in blood flow to the local 
      vasculature that accompanies neural activity in the brain. This results in 
      a corresponding local reduction in deoxyhemoglobin because the increase in 
      blood flow occurs without an increase of similar magnitude in oxygen 
      extraction (Roy and Sherrington, 1890; Plum, Posner &amp; Troy, 1968; 
      Posner, Plum &amp; Poznak, 1969; Fox and Raichle, 1985). Since 
      deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic, it alters the T2* weighted magnetic 
      resonance image signal (Ogawa, et al, 1990a and b, 1992, 1993; Belliveau, 
      et al, 1990, 1991; Turner, et al, 1991; Tank, et al, 1992). Thus, 
      deoxyhemoglobin is sometimes referred to as an endogenous contrast 
      enhancing agent, and serves as the source of the signal for fMRI. Using an 
      appropriate imaging sequence, human cortical functions can be observed 
      without the use of exogenous contrast enhancing agents on a clinical 
      strength (1.5 T) scanner (Bandettini, et al, 1992, 1993; Kwong, et al, 
      1992; and Turner, et al, 1993; Schneider, et al, 1993). Functional 
      activity of the brain determined from the magnetic resonance signal has 
      confirmed known anatomically distinct processing areas in the visual 
      cortex (Belliveau, et al, 1991; Ogawa, et al, 1992; Blamire, et al, 1992; 
      Schneider, et al, 1993; Hirsch, et al, 1995), the motor cortex (Kim, et 
      al, 1993a; Kim, et al, 1993b), and Broca's area of speech and 
      language-related activities (Hinke, et al, 1993, Kim, et al, 1995). 
      Further, a rapidly emerging body of literature documents corresponding 
      findings between fMRI and conventional electrophysiological techniques to 
      localize specific functions of the human brain (Atlas, et al, 1996; Puce, 
      et al, 1995; Burgess, 1995; Detre, et al, 1995; George, et al, 1995; Ives, 
      et al, 1993). Consequently, the number of medical and research centers 
      with fMRI capabilities and investigational programs continues to escalate. 
      </P>
								<P>The main advantages to fMRI as a technique to image brain activity 
      related to a specific task or sensory process include 1) the signal does 
      not require injections of radioactive isotopes, 2) the total scan time 
      required can be very short, i.e., on the order of 1.5 to 2.0 min per run 
      (depending on the paradigm), and 3) the in-plane resolution of the 
      functional image is generally about 1.5 x 1.5 mm although resolutions less 
      than 1 mm are possible. To put these advantages in perspective, functional 
      images obtained by the earlier method of positron emission tomography, 
      PET, require injections of radioactive isotopes, multiple acquisitions, 
      and, therefore, extended imaging times. Further, the expected resolution 
      of PET images is much larger than the usual fMRI pixel size. Additionally, 
      PET usually requires that multiple individual brain images are combined in 
      order to obtain a reliable signal. Consequently, information on a single 
      patient is compromised and limited to a finite number of imaging sessions. 
      Although these limitations may serve many neuroscience applications, they 
      are not optimally suitable to assist in a neurosurgical or treatment plan 
      for a specific individual.</P>
								
      <P><U><B><font color="black">METHODS AND 
      PROCEDURES</font><BR>
										</B></U>The particular imaging methods 
      and procedures vary from center-to-center because each group has 
      independently developed the methods and analysis procedures required to 
      acquire and process functional data. There is not yet a commercial package 
      of software and standardized tasks for clinical use. A brief summary of 
      our clinical techniques is described below, and serves to illustrate the 
      general conditions. </P>
      <P>Image Acquisition: Images are acquired using a T2* weighted 
      gradient echo sequence: TE = 60 ms, TR = 3 secs, flip angle = 90 deg on a 
      1.5 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging System (General Electric) located in the 
      Department of Radiology at Columbia. This system is equipped with echo 
      planar options which provides very rapid image acquisitions. Slice 
      thickness is usually set at 5 mm but can be as thin as 3 mm. Simultaneous 
      images are acquired on as many as 16 contiguous slices (21 slices with 
      longer acquisition times) oriented along any suitable plane. Each imaging 
      series requires approximately 30 complete head volume acquisitions. 
      </P>
      <P>Image Processing: An image processing facility has been 
      developed as a stand-alone system outside of the scanner system. This 
      facility provides the computational capability required to reconstruct the 
      large numbers of images and provides the statistical analyses that 
      identify the anatomical regions that are active during specific tasks. 
      </P>
      <P>Task Procedure: Patients and subjectsare positioned in the 
      scanner as for a conventional scan, and plane lines are set based on 
      conventional imaging methods. During a typical functional imaging series, 
      30 images are acquired in a 90 sec run where the initial and last 10 
      images are baseline conditions and the middle 10 images (30 secs) are 
      acquired during a task. For example, in the case of a typical task 
      designed to identify eloquent brain tissue involved in hand and finger 
      movement, the patient taps fingers and thumb during the activity epoch. 
      The beginning and end of this activity period is cued by a visual or 
      auditory signal and occurs at images 10 and 20, respectively. Language, 
      sensory, visual, auditory and other targeted functions are imaged in a 
      similar manner. A task-induced signal change is illustrated in Fig. 1 for 
      a sensory task involving tactile stimulation (touching) the left hand. The 
      abscissa represents a 30 image acquisition run during a 90 sec period. The 
      initial 10 pre-stimulation (baseline) images are followed by 10 activation 
      images (left hand stimulation) and 10 post-stimulation images. Each 90 sec 
      imaging series (illustrated by the intensity levels for one voxel) is 
      actually repeated twice although only one series is illustrated. In this 
      example the left hand stimulation results in right hemisphere activity and 
      presumably represents the post central sulcus sensory strip. </P>

      src="images/fRMI-thum3.jpg" width=195 
      align=left border=0></A><U>Figure 1</U>. A 5 mm axial slice is 
      shown with the voxels indicated (small boxes) that show significant signal 
      changes with left hand tactile stimulation. The intensity trace indicates 
      the changes for one voxel during one image acquisition sequence of 30 
      images where images 1-10 were acquired during baseline conditions, images 
      11-20 were acquired during the task, and images 21-30 were acquired during 
      baseline-recovery. Statistical analysis of each voxel in the entire brain 
      over the 60 total acquisitions identifies the voxels with activity-related 
      signal changes. </P>
      <P>Data analysis: Statistical analyses have been developed to 
      identify areas of the brain activated by specific tasks and are based on a 
      multistage comparison of stimulation and resting intensity levels as well 
      as multiple replications (Hirsch, et al, 1994 a and b; Hirsch, et al, 
      1995). These successive stages of analysis are illustrated in Fig. 2 for 
      left hand finger-thumb tapping. The schematic "homonculus" illustrates 
      that the expected and observed locations of brain activity during this 
      task appear coincident. </P>
      <P><A href="images/fRMI-big8.gif"><IMG height=133 
      alt='"Click to see bigger view"' 
      src="images/fRMI-thum8.jpg" width=195 
      align=left border=0></A>The fundamental unit of analysis is the 
      single voxel as shown on Fig. 1 identified by its coordinates x, y, and z 
      where x and y indicate the in-plane location and z indicates the slice. 
      Significant voxels (as shown in Fig. 1) indicate regions of the brain 
      activated by a specific task. Empirical probability distributions based on 
      phantom images (CuSO<SUB>4</SUB> solution filled sphere) confirm that the 
      probability of a significant result by chance is less than 0.0001. Voxels 
      that do not show a significant intensity change during the activity period 
      are not colored. Rather, they are represented by the mean level which 
      yields the anatomic detail for each slice of brain. </P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations of human brain mapping with these 
      procedures have yielded insights into the functional organization of 
      various sensory, motor, and language systems (Hirsch, et al, 1994 a-c, 
      1995 a-c Kim, et al, 1995; Lee, et al, 1995) and our goal is to transfer 
      and apply these techniques to benefit patient care. Some possible 
      applications are discussed below. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><U><B><font color="black">FUTURE ROLE IN NEUROSURGICAL 
      PLANNING</font><BR>
										</B></U>Since neurosurgery relies on a 
      precise delineation of the structural and functional aspects of brain, the 
      role for fMRI in neurosurgical planning is potentially very significant. 
      The need for individualized maps of brain function is enhanced when the 
      presence of a tumor alters the expected location of a function, or when 
      the location of the tumor is in an area with an uncertain function such as 
      association cortices or language-related processes. An emerging group of 
      investigators have reported fMRI results that are consistent with 
      electrophysiology, PET, cortical stimulation, and magneto-encephalography 
      and serve to document that fMRI does provide a source of precise 
      functional and structural information for Neurosurgery (Burgess, 1995; 
      George, et al, 1995; Simpson, et al, 1995, Puce, (1995a,b); Fried, et al, 
      1995; Peyron, 1995; Clifford, et al, 1995; Haglund, 1995; Detre, et al, 
      1995; and Ives, et al, 1993). Further, the potential role of fMRI in 
      directing decisions about surgical and diagnostic procedures has also been 
      demonstrated (Atlas, S.W., et al, 1996). </P>
      <P>The following example illustrates the potential advantage of 
      functional plus anatomical information for surgical treatment of brain 
      tumors that are located near active areas of brain. </P>
      <P><A href="images/fRMI-big11.gif"><IMG height=133 
      alt='"Click to see bigger view"' 
      src="images/fRMI-thum11.jpg" width=195 
      align=left border=0></A>A single axial slice is shown in Fig. 3 for 
      a 32 year old male patient before and after resection of a left frontal 
      lobe GBM. Prior to surgery various language and speech tasks were employed 
      to chart functional language areas in the vicinity of the tumor. The left 
      slice shows an area active during extemporaneous speech just posterior and 
      adjacent to the tumor. The right slice shows the same area of brain 
      following the resection. The speech area remains just posterior to the 
      resected tumor bed and the patient experienced no speech deficit following 
      surgery. This example also illustrates a potential challenge for 
      functional imaging. The choices of tasks must be selected based on prior 
      knowledge of functions near the targeted areas. Therefore, a null finding 
      may only mean that the optimal task was not applied.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Currently, a cohort of neurosurgical patients are participants 
      in a protocol at Columbia to evaluate the potential applications of fMRI 
      for neurosurgical planning. These patients receive a standard battery of 
      tasks targeted to localize language, sensory, motor and visual areas both 
      as candidates for surgery and as post-surgical patients. Functional 
      imaging results are compared with all conventional mapping studies 
      performed on each patient including the WADA test, intraoperative cortical 
      stimulation, electrophysiological assessments, and neurologic assessments 
      of surgical outcome. The objective of this on-going investigation is to 
      determine the potential role of functional mapping for neurosurgical 
      procedures. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><U><B><font color="black">FUTURE ROLE IN PAIN 
      MANAGEMENT</font><BR>
										</B></U>The experience of chronic and 
      persistent pain is a debilitating condition for which the role of cortical 
      processing is not well understood. We have focused on the identification 
      of cortical areas that are modified by the reduction of pain following 
      pain therapy. This novel approach to investigate the cortical 
      representation associated with relief of pain has originated from our 
      pilot studies where patients with chronic sympathetically maintained pain 
      affecting one extremity (post herpetic neuralgia) were studied by 
      comparing brain responses to light touch applied to the "now-affected" 
      limb and to the "painful" limb before and after treatment (Hewitt, et al, 
      1995). These studies indicate that the cortical representation of 
      sympathetically maintained pain involves specific and identifiable 
      cortical activity, as well as does the relief of that pain achieved by a 
      peripheral nerve block procedure. Continuing investigations will extend 
      these findings to other pain treatments to determine the extent to which 
      this finding is generalizable to other pain relief mechanisms. These 
      preliminary studies suggest a wide range of other approaches using fMRI to 
      investigate cortical representations of specific pain types, and 
      therefore, new specific therapy options. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><U><B><font color="black">FUTURE ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING THE 
      PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR NEUROLOGICAL 
      DISORDERS</font><BR>
										</B></U>The following example 
      illustrates the potential of fMRI to yield new insights into physiological 
      bases for disfunction. A 16 year old right handed female with a congenital 
      malformation in the right posterior frontal lobe and a seizure disorder 
      participated in a functional imaging study to identify functional 
      sensorimotor areas. One of the patient's typical sensory seizures occured 
      during one of the runs. This enabled us to localize fMRI signals 
      associated with the onset of a spontaneous seizure, its progression, and 
      the relationship to normally activated motor cortex. There was minimal 
      movement artifact which was further reduced by alignment of the images 
      prior to a voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis. The fMRI signals 
      associated with the seizure were first observed in an area adjacent to the 
      normal motor activity. MR signal amplitudes exceeded the normal functional 
      activity by as much as a factor of 5. A sequential time analysis (6 sec 
      intervals) revealed both local spreading of the onset focus and the 
      emergence of subsequent foci first in the ipsilateral prefrontal areas, 
      and the mesial surface areas. These were followed by activity in the 
      homologous regions of the opposite hemisphere suggesting that the 
      generalization followed a specific pattern of functional connectivity. 
      Thus, eloquent motor activity and seizure activity were co-localized using 
      fMRI, and the onset, progression pattern, time course, and relative MR 
      amplitudes of the seizure event were observed (Hirsch, et al,1996). This 
      case illustrates that fMRI may contribute to improved precision of seizure 
      localization and understanding of seizure progression, and suggests a 
      future direction for investigation. </P>
      <P>Other neurological conditions currently under investigation 
      using fMRI at Columbia include neglect syndromes, phantom pain, cerebellar 
      dysfunction, and neural reorganization. Preliminary studies confirm that 
      the pathways and processes involved in these neurological disorders and 
      conditions can be observed for investigation by fMRI. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><U><B><font color="black">FUTURE ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING THE 
      PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR COGNITIVE AND PERCEPTUAL 
      EVENTS</font><BR>
										</B></U>Due to the ability to image the 
      entire 3-dimensional volume of brain, fMRI is capable of isolating many 
      simultaneous and coordinated brain events. This "multi-level" view of 
      brain activity can include "executive" functions and high level cognitive 
      tasks simultaneously with the primary and secondary input such as vision 
      and audition as well as cerebellar contributions. We are currently 
      applying fMRI methods to identify brain structures uniquely involved with 
      visual perceptions, language generation, comprehension of sequential 
      information as in a movie, the execution of visually guided responses, and 
      complex problem solving. These aspects of brain function have not 
      previously been scrutinized with such precision, and represent some of the 
      remaining frontiers in Neuroscience. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><U><B><font color="black">SUMMARY AND FUTURE 
      DIRECTIONS</font><BR>
										</B></U>The goal of this presentation 
      was to introduce the basics of fMRI and to suggest potential future 
      applications in neuro-oncology. Based on our initial investigations, these 
      future directions include neurosurgical planning and improved assessment 
      of risk for individual patients, improved assessment and strategies for 
      the treatment of chronic pain, improved seizure localization, and improved 
      understanding of the physiology of neurological disorders. We look ahead 
      to these and other emerging applications as the benefits of this 
      technology become incorporated into current and future patient care.
