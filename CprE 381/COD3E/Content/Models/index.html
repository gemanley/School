		<h2><a name="picoProcessor"></a>picoProcessor</h2>
		<p>The picoProcessor (pP) is an 8-bit processor intended for education purposes. It is similar to typical 8-bit microprocessors for small embedded applications, but has an instruction set architecture more similar to RISC processors. The VHDL model suite includes a behavioral model, a model of an unpipelined implementation that performs each instruction in a single clock cycle, and an unpipelined implementation that performs each instruction in several clock cycles.</p>

		<h2><a name="TinyMIPS"></a>TinyMIPS</h2>
		<p>TinyMIPS is an implementation of a small subset of the MIPS instruction set, using the GateSim simulator. GateSim is included on this CD; <a href="../Software/index.html#GateSim" target="Display">click here</a> for more information and installation instructions.</p>
		<p>TinyMIPS is more or less compatible with the <a onclick="parent.frames[0].select_img(14); return true;" href="../Software/index.html#Spim">Spim simulator</a> (also included on this CD). MIPS assembly language programs can be assembled in Spim, then the result saved as a log file that TinyMIPS can read and decode.</p>
