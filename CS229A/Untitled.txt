Rules of references
	References can't be null (They must always refer to a legit variable or object)
	Once est., a reference can't be changed
	A reference does not require any explicit dereferencing

Not only can you have variables as references, you can also pass parameters to functions by reference

Example:

void passTest(int &i)
{
	i++;
}

int j = 5;
passTest(j);
count << j;  Output is 6

A reference can be used as the target of an assignment statement.  These seem to be obvious and normalâ€¦

Example:
int values[100];
int & index(int i)
{
	return values[i + 2];
}

main()
{
	index(27) = 12;
} // Sets the value of values[29] to 12
