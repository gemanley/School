<h1>Lab 3: Memory Mapped I/O</h1>


<h2>Lecture - Lab Connection</h2>

<p>In lecture, you have studied memory mapped I/O and the concept of API 
(application programming interface) functions.  The general purpose input/output pins (GPIO) 
are grouped into sets of 8 pins, called ports.  You will use these concepts and 
the related skills to develop functionality that allows a person to interact 
with a running program through push buttons and a shaft encoder and control the 
motion of a stepper motor.</p>

<h2>Prelab</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Read through the lab description, including the linked documents.</li>
    <li>Skim the reference documents below; in particular, you should skim pages 65-88 of the <a href="resources/docs/doc2467.html">ATmega128 Datasheet</a>, with a focus on understanding the bottom of page 66.  In addition, read page 8 of the <a href="../../resources/docs/EC11.pdf">Shaft Encoder Datasheet</a>.</li>
	<li>Read through the source code for util.c.  It has been heavily commented to assist you.</li>
    <li>Print the <a href="lab_eval.doc">Lab Evaluation Form</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reference Documents</h2>

<p>All reference documents are also available on the Resources page of the course website.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Port C is used by the push buttons as well as the shaft encoder. To read data from this port, use the register PINC.</li>
  <li>The push buttons on Port C are active low. For example, if SW3 button is <strong>not</strong> pushed, the 
  corresponding bit (i.e. PC2) within the byte from PINC will be a value of 1. If it is pushed, the corresponding
  bit is 0. This push button circuit is designed to pull the appropriate MCU pin low by making contact to ground.</li>
</ul>





<hr>
<h2>Part 1. Push Buttons</h2>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong> - Implement the read_push_buttons() function in util.c and display the currently pressed button on the LCD screen.</p>

<p>In this part, you will complete an API function for the push 
buttons on the LCD display board. The function read_push_buttons() in util.c is currently unimplemented.
Write code in the function such that it returns the position of the button being pressed. For example, the position of the leftmost push button on the board, 
labeled as SW6, is 6. If multiple buttons are being pushed, the function should only
return the index of the leftmost button and ignore the other buttons. If no button is pushed, 0 should 
be returned.</p>

<p>The function prototype has been written in util.c. Additionally, there are comments on which port is associated 
with the push buttons. Complete the function body of read_push_buttons().</p>

<p>You will also need to write a program continually calls read_push_buttons() and displays the result on the screen.  Do not forget about the initialization functions!  Here's an example of such a program:</p>


<p>
<font face="courier">
#include "lcd.h" <br>
#include "util.h" <br>
   <br>
void main() { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lcd_init();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init_push_buttons();<br>
   <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(1) {  // loop indefinitely <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char button = read_push_buttons();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lprintf("Button: %d", button);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
   <br>
}<br><br>
</font>
</p>


<p><strong>If you have completed this section of the lab within the first 30 minutes of lab, move on to Part 2.  The parts of the lab are cummulative, and demoing the last part to the TA is sufficient for receiving all points.  If you think you will fail to complete the entire lab within the lab period, you may demo this part to your TA for partial credit and demo the remaining parts at the beginning of your next lab session.</strong></p>




<hr>
<h2>Part 2. Shaft Encoder</h2>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong> - Implement the read_shaft_encoder() function in util.c.  Modify your program from part 1 to display both the currently pressed push button and a sum of the return values from read_shaft_encoder() on the LCD screen.

<p> The shaft encoder is a human input device that is primarily used to allow a user to increment or decrement a value 
(such as the volume on a stereo).  The shaft encoder selected for the VORTEX platform has no absolute position.  
What can be known is whether the shaft encoder has been turned clockwise or counter-clockwise. The shaft encoder 
used in our lab is a mechanical shaft encoder. There are essentially two switches that 
close and open in an order dependent upon the direction of rotation. The 
shaft encoder is wired to the Port C pins PC6 (for channel A) and PC7 (for 
channel B) of the MCU, so that each internal switch is either monitored by PC6 
or by PC7. As each of the internal switches closes, the switch pulls the 
respective MCU pin low to ground. An open switch results in a high voltage (5 V or 
so) on the respective MCU pin. The result of the alternating voltages is 
a square wave, but since the two waveforms lag or lead the other by a phase 
angle these signals are said to be quadrature signals. Traditionally these 
signals were called quadrature signals for the phase angle between was commonly 
90 degrees. As the shaft is rotated clockwise channel A will lead channel 
B. As the shaft is rotated counter-clockwise channel B will lead channel A. </p>

<img alt="" src="images/quadrature_signals.gif" width="649" height="153"></p>

<p>The objective of Part II is for your team to implement the function read_shaft_encoder() in util.c such that it will read the 
shaft encoder and return values according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When the shaft is rotated clockwise return 1</li>
	<li>When the shaft is rotated counter-clockwise return -1</li>
	<li>When the shaft is not rotated return 0</li>
</ul>

<p>The function prototype is already present in util.c and in util.h. Much of the function has been written.
It has incomplete statements that need your attention. No additional lines of code should be necessary.</p>
			
<p>Write a program that continually calls this function and keeps a sum of the return values from the function.  If the shaft encoder
 is left alone, the sum should remain constant.  If the shaft encoder is rotated, the sum will increase or decrease.  Display the sum 
 on the LCD display along with the currently pressed push button.</p> 
 
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> - Don't forget to call the proper initialization functions once at the beginning of your program.  The function shaft_encoder_init() will initialize the ports correctly for the shaft encoder.</p>

<p>Using memory mapped I/O to determine the direction of rotation 
of the shaft encoder has timing challenges. Do not be overly concerned 
about supporting a wide range of rotation speeds. Work on rotation speeds 
that are comfortable and easy to maintain.</p>

<p><strong>If you have completed this section of the lab within the first hour of lab, move on to Part 3.  The parts of the lab are cummulative, and demoing the last part to the TA is sufficient for receiving all points.  If you think you will fail to complete the entire lab within the lab period, you may demo this part to your TA for partial credit and demo the remaining parts at the beginning of your next lab session.</strong></p>




<hr>
<h2>Part 3. Stepper Motor</h2>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong> - Implement the move_stepper_motor_by_step() function in util.c.  Expand your program from part 2 so that it additionally rotates the stepper motor when the shaft encoder is rotated.

<p>The unipolar stepper motor being 
used in this lab has 200 steps, which translates to 1.8 degrees of rotation per 
step. The stepper motor's rotation can be controlled by simply 
energizing the motor's windings in a sequence. The sequence order will 
define the direction of rotation. The control lines for the stepper motor 
have been wired to Port E on pins PE4-PE7. The driver chip expects 
positive logic whereby a 1 on one of the PE4-PE7 pins is translated into 
energizing the winding associated with that pin. Only one winding should 
be energized at one time for this lab. So motor control translates into 
shifting a bit value of 1 across the upper four bits of PORTE.</p>

<p>A function skeleton for move_stepper_motor_by_step()
has been started in util.c. Normally a function like this would have 
three parameters (number of steps, direction, speed), but for now we will focus 
on two parameters. So for this part of the lab, complete the function so 
that the motor will turn the specified number of steps in the direction 
requested. A direction value of 1 should be interpreted to mean clockwise 
and -1 to mean counter-clockwise. In order for this function to move the 
stepper accurately each time it is invoked, the previous stepper energizing 
pattern needs to be known (i.e. the values PE4-PE7 need to saved) so that the 
first energizing pattern produced by the current function invocation does not 
cause the motor to skip step positions.</p>

<p>The stepper motor is being energized by a 14V supply, so the amount of power 
consumed relative to other components on the board is quite high. The 
power draw of the motor is minimized when the driver chip does not see a call 
for any windings to be energized (i.e. the output of PE4 through PE7 is low or 
logic 0). After having moved the motor into position, set pins PE4-PE7 to 
0. This will make the motor susceptible to rotation by an external force 
for no holding torque will be generated, but for our current purposes that is 
acceptable. Your TA will verify that you have de-energized the motor during the 
lab demonstration.</p>

<p>After completing move_stepper_motor_by_step(), write a program that 
will couple the shaft encoder to the stepper motor. The objective of the 
program is to have the stepper move position as the shaft encoder is 
turned. The direction of rotation of the stepper should match that of the 
shaft encoder. There should be a one-to-one correspondence between steps moved 
and the number of positions the shaft encoder is turned. Before 
attempting to move the stepper motor, the stepper needs to be initialized by 
calling the stepper_init() function.</p>

<p>After completing the one-to-one correspondence coupling, you could try mapping 
absolute position of the stepper with the shaft encoder. There are 20 
positions on the shaft encoder and 200 steps, so 10 steps of stepper movement 
would be needed for each shaft encoder move. You are welcome to try other 
mappings between the shaft encoder and stepper.
</p>


<p><strong>Demo your program to your TA.</strong></p>


<hr>
<h2>Cautions</h2>
                
<p>Never leave a powered-down JTAGICE mkII connected to a powered robot - current may 
leak from the unit and result in damage to the emulator.  Try to leave the blue JTAGICE 
mkII box powered on at all times.</p>

<p>Turn the power to the Cerebot board and iRobot off before charging.  The Cerebot 
board consumes power and the battery will not charge if the robot is in full_mode (which 
it enters after calling oi_init, turing the power LED yellow).  The robot is charging 
when the robot's power LED is pulsing red and both green LEDS on the dock are lit.</p>
