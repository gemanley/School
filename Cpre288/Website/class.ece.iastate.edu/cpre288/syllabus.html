F.S.  Embedded C programming. Interrupt      handling. Memory mapped I/O in the context of an application. Elementary embedded design      flow/methodology. Timers, scheduling, resource allocation, optimization, state machine based      controllers, real time constraints within the context of an application. Applications laboratory      exercises with embedded devices. </p>   <p>     <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> CprE 281, Com S 207 or Com S 227. </p>      <strong>Website:</strong> http://class.ee.iastate.edu/cpre288/ <br /> <br /> </p>     <p><strong>Meeting Times and Places: <br /> </strong> <b>Lecture (Sections A-E):</b> Tu/Tr 9:30am-10:50am, Hoover 1213, with Dr. Zhao Zhang. <br/> <b>Lecture (Sections F,G,J)</b>: Tu/Tr 2:10pm-3:30pm, Howe 1252, with Dr. Phillip Jones. </p>     <p> Labortary: All labs are in 2041 Coover. </p>   <p>     <strong>Required Textbook:</strong> None. </p>   <p>     <strong>Related Textbooks: </strong>(not required)     <ul>         <li>Embedded C Programming and the Atmel AVR, Barnett, Cox, O'Cull, 2nd edition, Thompson, 2007.</li>         <li>Computer Organization & Design, Patterson & Hennessy, Morgan Kaufmann, 1998. (MIPS)</li>         <li>A Programmer's View of Computer Architecture, Goodman & Miller, Oxford University Press, 1993. (MIPS)</li>         <li>Introduction to Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, Bryant & O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall, 2002. (Intel)</li>         <li>Fundamentals of Embedded Software, Lewis, Prentice Hall, 2002. (Intel)</li>     </ul> </p>   <p>     <strong>C Programming Books: </strong>(may find these or similar books useful)     <ul>         <li>The C Programming Language, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, 1988. This is a             famous book (the second author is the original designer of the C language); better for programmers in another language.</li>         <li>C: A Reference Manual, Harbison and Steele, Morgan Kaufmann, 1998. This is a standard reference; better as a              reference than as an expository text. </li>         <li>Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets, Peter Van Der Linden, Prentice Hall, 1994. This explains many of the more              confusing aspects of C; helpful for even experienced C programmers.</li>     </ul> </p>  <p>   <p><strong>Why C, and why only C?    Why C?   </strong>This course is about low-level features in computers and programming, so we use a low-level programming language to emphasize that. Everything in C can be implemented on typical processors in a fairly straightforward manner, and it is thus often considered a high-level assembly language. Similarly, it exposes some details of the underlying machine, e.g., how data is stored in memory.   It is important to get experience in a variety of programming paradigms and languages.   To emphasize the importance of code documentation. Good code must be written so that others can understand it, and this requires extensive documentation. In higher-level languages, code is usually easier to understand.</p> <h3>Minimum Requirements&nbsp;</h3> <ul>  <li>Read all assigned material.</li>  <li>Actively participate in class discussions.</li>  <li>Satisfactorily complete all exams and other graded work.</li>  <li>Participate fully in group discussions.</li>  <li>Complete all work with an acceptable level of quality.</li>  <li>Complete and submit a course evaluation.</li>  <li>Follow University policy on integrity of scholarship and grades.</li>  <li>If you have special learning needs, please contact the instructor to make suitable arrangements.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul>  <li>You are required to access the course home page for relevant and timely information throughout the term.</li>  <li>Lab attendance is required. Please make sure that you do not indulge in disruptive behavior. </li>  <li>Be aware of the laboratory policies (see below). </li>  <li>Email is an effective way to communicate with the instructors.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Grading</strong></p> <ul>  <li>Some of your work is done in groups and some individually. An example of group      work are the regular laboratory exercises, and an example of      individual work is homework. <i>Exams</i> must be exclusively your      work; cheating will be dealt with per University regulations. Academic      dishonesty on class or laboratory work will be dealt with harshly, will result in a 0      on the assignment, and may result in a 0.0 for the course. (See section below on Scholastic Integrity)</li>  <li>The following grading scheme will be used (* denotes group work):</li> <ul>   <li> Exams: 45%</li>       <ul>            <li> Exam 1: Thu 9/27 (Week 6), 75 minutes</li>            <li> Exam 2: Thu 11/1 (Week 11), 75 minutes</li>            <li> Exam 3: Mon 12/10 (Exam week), 75 minutes            (tentative schedule) </li>       </ul>   <li>Homework: 15%</li>   <li>Regular Laboratory Exercises: 25%</li>   <li>Laboratory Project: 15%</li>   <li>TOTAL: 100%</li> </ul> </ul>  <ul>  <li><u>Homework grading:</u> Each homework will have a due date.      It is due in the class on the due date.  We would like you to complete all homeworks even if they are turned in late.  Thus, you can submit homework up to 3 days late at a penalty of 10% per day.  Answers will be published 3 days after the Due date.</li> </ul>    <p><b>Lab Policies</b></p>  <p>Pay special attention to the items in <b>bold</b>.</p>  <ul>  <li><b>Lab attendance is mandatory</b>. If you will be absent, you must notify the      lab instructor by email or phone <i>before</i> the absence for it to be an      excused absence. Unexcused absences may result in a zero for the      corresponding lab(s) and is sufficient cause for a zero lab score for the      semester, and in turn, a 0.0 grade for the course. </li>  <li>Students will typically work with partners or groups on lab work. Lab partners and      roles may be rotated during the term to give students different learning      experiences. The same      score will be awarded on group work unless there is evidence to support      different scores. </li>  <li>The lab should be worked on during its corresponding lab period. If the lab is      not completed during the lab period, it may be finished during any other      unscheduled/open lab time. <b>The lab must be demonstrated to your lab      instructor no later than the beginning of the next regular scheduled lab      time, otherwise it is considered late</b> (it must be ready to demonstrate      - students may not work on Lab <span class=SpellE><i>i</i></span> during      the period for Lab (<i>i+1</i>). <b>The late penalty is 20% for a lab if      it is turned in at any time within one week. After one week it will not be accepted.</b></li>  <li>Work can be done outside formal lab times to verify and test hardware and      software designs. Software design tools are available in the lab. </li>  <li>All code must be commented. </li> </ul>      <p><strong>Integrity of Scholarship and Grades:</strong> All students are to adhere   to the University's policy relating to integrity of scholarship and grades as  presented in the Student Information Handbook. (available <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~catalog/2009-2011/geninfo/dishonesty.html">here</a>)</p>    <p><strong>Students with Disabilities:</strong>If you have a disability and require  accommodations, please contact the instructor early in the semester so that  your learning needs may be appropriately met. You will need to provide documentation  of your disability to the Disability Resources (DR) office, located on the main floor  of the Student Services Building, Room 1076, 515-294-7220.</p>    					</section>
